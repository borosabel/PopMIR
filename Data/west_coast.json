Ha ha, please\nFinger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip\nLoose lips sink ships, it's a trip\nI love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking\nPut a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching\nConversations on the phone til the break of dawn\nNow we all alone, why the lights on?\nTurn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft\nSomething's on your mind, let it off\nYou don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me\nWell if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?\nIt's a lot of real G's doing time\nCause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie\nYou picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly\nYou need to hit the door, search for a new guy\nCause I only got one night in town\nBreak out or be clown, baby doll are you down?\nI get around\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, around we go, uhh\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, around we go\nRound and round, round we go\nRound and round, round we go\nRound and round, round we go, whoa\nRound and round\nRound and round\nRound and round"

Ewing of Seattle\nPicked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson\nHeading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action\nThe limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back\nMaharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap\nOn Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead\nWe need a new street so posse move ahead\nWe all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget\nThe Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set\n\nMy posse's on Broadway\nMy posse's on Broadway\nPosse up\nYou might also like\nRollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored\nThere's not another posse with more points scored\nWe don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas\nMy homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa\nMaharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak\nThe girlies see his booty and their knees get weak\nLarry is the white guy people think he's funny\nA real estate investor who makes a lot a money\nClocking lots a dollars, we all got gold\nCruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go\nWheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs\nThe girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs\nCause the rock man got em and their butts just drop\nThe freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop\nAt 23rd and Union the driver broke left\nKevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def\nMy girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best\nShe's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress\nThe closer that we get, the crazier I feel\nMy posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill\n\nMy posse's on Broadway\nMy posse's on Broadway\nPosse up\nCruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow\nRolling with your posse is the only way to go\nThe girlies by the college was looking for a ride\nWe tried to pick em up but we had no room inside\nWe put em on the trunk we put em on the hood\nSome sat up with the driver they made him feel good\nThe posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks\nMy muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak\nNow the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'\nWe stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'\nBut Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip\nThey said, \"Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's\"\nDick's is the place were the cool hang out\nThe swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout\nPosse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos\nWe're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews\nKid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it\nSkeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it\nHer boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face\nMy homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace\nCause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl\nIf you don't have game then let her leave your world\nWe took his girl with us\nWith him she rode the bus\nShe gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss\nBoy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes\nYou're broke cold crying about the rock man blues\nYa beat up on your girl and now your all upset\nShe's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway set6Embed"

        "lyrics": "34 ContributorsFreaky Tales Lyrics\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\n\nI met this girl, her name was Joan\nShe loved the way I rocked on the microphone\nWhen I met Joan, I took her home\nShe was just like a doggy all on my bone\nI met another girl, her name was Ann\nAll she wanted was to freak with a man\nWhen I met Ann, I shook her hand\nWe ended up freakin' by a garbage can\nThe next young freak I met was Red\nI took her to the house and she gave me head\nShe likes to freak is all she said\nWe jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed\nThere's another girl, her name is Mary\nTalk about sex and the girl acts scary\nI heard she was freakin' from my homeboy Jerry\nTook her to the house and I popped that cherry\nYoung and tender, sweet Denise\nGet her in the bed and the girl's a beast\nI tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece\nShe'll only start talking about signing a lease\nI met this tender, her name was Lori\nAn X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story\nShe had a twin sister, her name was Lisa\nAnd just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser\nMy girlfriend's name was Michelle\nHer booty was bigger than a tail on a whale\nWhen I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well\nHer pussy got hotter than the flames in hell\nI G'd this girl, her name is Tammy\nI didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy\nShe had a best friend, her name was Jane\nI pulled her to the side and I spit that game\nI met a lot of freaks in my lifespan\nFreaked one night with a girl named Pam\nThe very next day I saw her with her man\nOne week passed and I was in her again\nI had an old tender, her name's Janine\nShe was 32 and I was only eighteen\nShe likes to freak, she's just a fiend\nIt really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans\nI want a big freak, fat and sloppy\nI kick on back and I watch her mop me\nTwo tons of fun, big Mamma Jamma\nA country-girl from Alabama\nI met this freak, her name was Beth\nHer pussy got wet and it smelled like death\nI was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat\nBut I was all up in her trying to hold my breath\nBake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas\nShe said her name was Dinah\nShe was a built little freak from China\nI said I don't pimp or gigolo\nI'm having so much money, I don't need a hoe\nYou can break yourself but you can't break me\nYou never met a player like $hort, baby\nI knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo\nTook her to my house and we did it on the floor\nThe girl got freaky and I'll tell you more\nShe was down on her knees begging to blow\nShe's like another freak named Renée\nYou get her alone and she'll make your day\nLike Burger King, she knows the play\nBut a freak like Renée, you can have it your way...\nYou might also like\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\n\nI met this girl, thick as hell\nOnly sixteen, said her name was Linell\nI took her to my house, I could not wait\nHer shit was much tighter than a Century Safe\nLet me tell you this since we're talking young\nI met another girl, said her name was Yvonne\nAlways talking about having fun\nOnce again at the pad I had it going on\nI'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk\nI'm trying to get funky like \"Female Funk\"\nSo when you see me coming or see me going\nI keep my money, let the hoes keep hoeing\nI once met a hooker, she did it for free\nOn the Foothill bus number forty-three\nAll the way in the back she was working me\nHad my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat\nI met this freak named Antoinette\nMacked on baby like an ice cold vet\nEverything she had is what I get\n'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit\nI met another freak, her name was Rita\nBaby thought Too $hort just might eat her\nI told her like this, she could suck my peter\nOr either go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her\nScratched her name out my telephone book\nNever again took a second look\n'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon\nShe kept looking while I kept staring\nBaby came through with my homeboy Darren\nHer booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing\nShe never left, he cut out\nI know you all know what I'm talking about\nThere's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner\nShe smokes that pipe and she's getting thinner\nShannon is cool but her mind is gone\nOne fat rock and it's going on\nShe had another buddy, came by my place\nThick ass bitch, said her name was Grace\nShe walked in the door working lace\nYou shoulda seen that look that was on my face\nShe's like this tender named Belinda\nThe homeboys called her 'Belinda the Blender'\nShe gave head like she made it up\nShe was twenty years old with a big round butt\nHad a girl looked like Olive Oyl\nHer father was rich and the girl was spoiled\nWhen she got mad, her blood would boil\nBut I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\nThese are the tales, the freaky tales...\nThese are the tales that I tell so well...\n\nSugar Delight\nFriday night\nIt's going on\nToo $hort\n\nThree weeks ago, I met this freak\nShe followed me around like Mary's sheep\nI hid around the corner and when she came\nI grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name\nShe said it was Anita\nHer man's in Santa Rita\nI took her to my house and homeboy, I G'd her\nSent her on her way\nThe very next day, Playboy $hort was ready to play\nI bumped into this girl, her name's Roshawn\nWe hit the motel and had it going on\nHoliday Inn to the break of dawn\nWhen I took baby home, I freaked her mom\nI knew this tender named Shari\nI took her to the house and let her freak on me\nBaby was a fan, she loved my beat\nBut I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet\nI met this freak named Yolanda\nRolled baby doll like a brand new Honda\nI was on top, she was up under\nThe bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder\nI once had a date with a girl named Kitty\nShe was so fine with her big fat titties\nAll night long she was acting shitty\nSo I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti\nThere's another girl, her name is Rose\nI use to ride baby like brand new Vogues\nI never saw Rose wearing clothes\nShe's a Penthouse pet, ready to pose\nI was riding down the street when I met Janet\nHer booty was bigger than the whole damn planet\nAss everywhere, I just can't stand it\nTried to palm it but I could not manage\nI had this freak, her name was Bunny\nSaid I'm the only man who ever called her honey\nEverything I did to her was funny\nI macked on Bunny and I took her money\nEight, tonight, a date, with Shirley\nShe was real short and her hair was curly\nIf you saw baby you liked this girlie\nShe was so fine I went to get her early\nShirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel\nHer bite was vicious and it sure was fatal\nShe liked to kiss all on my navel\nThose are her lips on top of my label\nI knew another freak, her name was Candy\nReal big lips and they came in handy\nI smooth got worked and it was so dandy\nI hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy\nHe did me a favor in return\nGave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne\nBaby got tossed, then I got on\nI grabbed the microphone and started singing my song\nMy young homeboy heard me rap\nAnd said he had way more freaks than that\nSo I told him like this, they might be freaking\nBut, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...5Embed"

(Move, motherfucker, move now!)\nWhat the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?\nJust shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\nBut I didn't do shit\nMan, just shut the fuck up!\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand\nAnd tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\nI'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'\nSweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast\nOn a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n'Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do you got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me or another nigga\nAnd with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say\nFuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—\nFuck the police, fuck—\nFuck the police, fuck— fuck—\nFuck the police (The verdict)\n\nThe jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker\nWait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\nGet him out of here! (I want justice!)\nGet him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)\nOut, right now!\nFuck you, you black motherfuckers!\nFuck the police\nFuck the police\nFuck the police193Embed"

let the real motherfuckin' G's in\nYou're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper\nBut tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper\nTalkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot\nYou're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots\n(Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)\nBut Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday\nAll of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang\nBut on his old album cover he was a she-thang\nSo nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez\nMotherfuckin' real G's\nStop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless\nYo Dre, what's up\nBoy you should

than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta\nAin't broke a law in your life\nYet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife\nJust take a good look at the, nigga and you'll capture\nThe fact that the bastard, is simply just an actor\nWho mastered the bang and the slang and the mental\nOf niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central\nNever ever once have you ran with the turf\nBut yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt\nBut tell me who's a witness, to your fuckin' work\nSo you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk\nNiggas straight kill me, knowing that they pranksters\nThis is going out to you studio gangstas\nSee I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that\nSo since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that\nBut niggas like you, I gotta hate ya\nCause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas\nTalking about they come from projects\nKnowing you ain't seen the parts of the streets G\nThink you started trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty\nWearing khakis and mob while you rhyme\nLittle fag, tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time\nAnd your set don't accept ya\nScared to kick it with your homies cause you know they don't respect ya\nSo nigga please, check nuts before ya step to these\nMotherfuckin real G's\nWell, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta\nApproach me like you hard, motherfucker I'mma bank ya\nShank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to\nDr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors\nPranksters, studio gangstas, busters\nBut this time you're dealin' with some

dick\nBeating up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again\nSome niggas think it makes a man\nDamn it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick\nFrom wearin' lipstick, to smoking on chronic at picnics\nAnd now you think you're bigger\nBut to me you ain't nothing but a bitch-ass nigga\nThat ain't worth a food stamp\nAnd at Death Row, I hear you're getting treated like boot camp\nGotta follow your sergeant's directions\nOr get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson\nLearn a lesson from the Eaze\nStay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin G's\nStop him in his tracks, show him

(What's up?)\nTell 'em where you from!\n\nStraight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga\nMore punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger\nI'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this\nBut the pussy-ass niggas won't show this\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps\nIf not from the records, from jacking or craps\nJust like burglary, the definition is jacking\nAnd when I'm legally armed it's called packing\nShoot a motherfucker in a minute\nI find a good piece of pussy and go up in it\nSo if you're at a show in the front row\nI'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho\nYou'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to\nBut that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to\nA crazy motherfucker from the street\nAttitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit\nMC Ren controls the automatic\nFor any dumb motherfucker that starts static\nNot the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself\nEvery time I pull an AK off the shelf\nThe security is maximum and that's a law\nR-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw\nSee, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain\nThe definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'\nThat's taking place without a clue\nAnd once you're on the scope, your ass is through\nLook, you might take it as a trip\nBut a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip\nStraight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\nEazy is his name, and the boy is coming\n\nStraight outta Compton\nIs a brother that'll smother your mother\nAnd make your sister think I love her\nDangerous motherfucker raising hell\nAnd if I ever get caught, I make bail\nSee, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem\nI see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him\nBut I'm smart, lay low, creep a while\nAnd when I see a punk pass, I smile\nTo me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving\nBut don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling\nLooking for the one they call Eazy\nBut here's a flash, they'll never seize me\nRuthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload\nYou see a spark and jump over hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration\nFeel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgetting\nSo what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is an autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\nDamn, that shit was dope!190Embed"
