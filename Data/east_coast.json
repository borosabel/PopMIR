I'll take it, frame by frame it\nTo have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it\nO is for \"other,\" P is for \"people,\" scratch your temple\nThe last P, well, that's not that simple, huh\nIt's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten\nIt's five little letters that are missing here\nYou get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming\nIt seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it\nYou ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?\nYou get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow\nYou get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about\nThen you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?\nIt's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T\nIt's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)\nIt's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it\nThere's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it\nHow many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?\nWho think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?\nWell, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it\nBut if you don't, here's your membership\nYou might also like\nYou down with O.P.P.?

(All the homies)\n\nWell, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted\nThe first two letters the same, but the last is something different\nIt's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest\nIt's another five-letter word rhyming with \"cleanest\" or \"meanest\"\nI won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly\nI'll say the last P, hmm, stands for \"property\"\nNow lady, here comes a kiss\nBlow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly\nHave you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?\nAnd you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?\nYou looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away\nHe had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway\nYou couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care\n'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there\nWhen y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know\nAnd y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door\nNow don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high\nSay O.P.P.

I’m pure\nI insert my lifeline into the track, the energy in me\nIs a poison with no unrevealed remedy\nI’m spreading like leprosy throughout the record label\n‘Cause mines put me and Monch’s career in jeopardy\nCan you come see me in the ghetto where it’s dark?\nBullets are real, lost peeps lurks in the heart\nLord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb\nExecute first things first and put blunted minds to work\nMy herd’s tight and my fans supports, so I’m a-ight for\nThe time being, seeing peace but taking no shorts (No shorts)\nYou might also like\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, stress\n(album version includes a short “taxi cab” skit here)\n\nYou will now\nConsider me the apocalyptic one.  After this\nRhyme, henceforth, there is none\nNo more will exist when I emerge from\nThe mist in whence I was born into, scorned\nMost of you can’t even comprehend what I am saying to you\nEven in my human form the message I’m relaying\nWhy do you choose to mimic these wack emcees?\nWhy do you choose to listen to R&B?\nWhy must you believe that something is phat\nJust because it’s played on the radio 20 times per day?\nMy perception of poetical injection is ejaculation\nThe immaculate conception\nThe hall-walker who stalks bodies in Central Park\nSoon, emergency services’ll outline that\nBody in chalk, then I begin to walk away and spit\nThen when I walk away, I talk shit!  Huh!\nA jogger sprayed my face with mace, she didn’t\nKnow that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste\nWhen I’m in the backseat of your mid-town\nTaxi, don’t even ask me for the cash, G\nThe four cabs before didn’t pick me up\nNow ask yourself: who the fuck’s gonna stick me up?\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress\nCrush, kill, destroy, stress2Embed"

Quadra 950 lungs misty\nCalling me “Maximilian” ‘cause I'm that crazy robot\nTeetering on the edge of outer space\nSpitting buckshots ‘til black holes surround me.  You found me\nAs far as I'm concerned, I got your ashes in an urn\nBig up the temperamental, holds-none-barred kid\nWhat's your confunction?  Tracks is type dusty\nDrinking water out the well of life and I'ma piss it back rusty\nFlesh in phonics.  You're goddamn right\nI'm on it like aorta pacemakers hooked up to clappers\nClap off.  Welcome to my free-form jubilee\nLook at me, the witness to the shit you wanna be\nDBA, lyrical P, burners insipid\nI’m a sycophant, feeding on fats passed and dipped\nIn and out of my invisible state.  Forerunner rep tyrannical\nWrecks like TECs, bust mechanical\nRusty garden weasel painting beats on an easel\nShoot a head up.  What, bitch?  You're boxing shadows\nLook out my way, you’ll pull the breath out your battle\nBreaking your double helix and now the shit is single\nNot mono.  I burn the needle out your phono\nEl-P the third gunner on the grassy knoll, stroll\nKeep the seventh seal of heaven in my pocket\nYou're faggot like Sprockets.  Yo, motherfuck the Houston Rockets\nI'm so sick of recycled metaphors\nBet, but I'd fuck Laura Ingalls only when she's done with her chores\nGot rappers tip-toeing on a Highway to Heaven\nGot manners like Bruce Banner when he's stressed\nI'm sick of your corny beats and your crowd-involved hooks\n'Cause I'm a thinker\nEvil anus letting off stinkers\nEight steps to perfection\nThe sum of each part forms a octagon\nLet rhyme styles get sparked\nEight steps to perfection\nThe sum of each part forms a octagon\nWhere rhyme styles get sparked\n\nThe holy terror, last move you made was an error, won't win\nPlaying taps on a violin\nYou can never comprehend the rhyme origin\nIrate when I get Chinese—Jamaican like a Chin\nHot rocking corduroy, Ballies that's so fitted\nNiggas came and assed out my tracks and left 'em shitted\nFuck the movement, lubricate the smooth shit\nJust to let you know, never do I use it\nStrictly the blueprint for the ghetto music in my cypher\nShorty the sniper, Jeep like Cherokee\nWhen I take aim handling wall-to-wall emcees\nMr. Madman attract lyrics like magnets\nThat fuck up speaker cabinets when I'm stabbing it\nLike the Juice, then go Bronco busting loose\nThat's my word.  You couldn't shoot or try to compute the math\nTo kick any tight sport like the vandal\nI manhandle.  Emcees get murdered like Tenor Saw\nOr trapped in the bedroom with the Texas Chainsaw\nMassacre.  One Two Three, The Taking of Pelham\nEastwick, underground New York be the dwelling\nI keep telling ‘em the state of the mind be the mentals\nIf you murder up in the ghetto, you’re murdering a temple7Embed"

(yeah)\nHere we go\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen people wore pajamas and lived life slow\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood\nAnd people were behavin' like they ought ta good\nThere lived a lil' boy who was misled\nBy anotha lil' boy and this is what he said\n\"Me and Ty, we gonna make sum cash\nRobbin' old folks and makin' the dash\"\nThey did the job, money came with ease\nBut one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease\nHe robbed another and another and a sister and her brother (stick 'em up, stick 'em up)\nTried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover\nThe cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic\nHe said \"Keep still, boy, no need for static\"\nPunched him in his belly and he gave him a slap\nBut little did he know the lil' boy was strapped\nThe kid pulled out a gun, he said, \"Why did ya hit me?\"\nThe barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney\nThe cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure\n\"I'll do years if I pull this trigger\"\nSo he cold dashed and ran around the block\nCop radios in to another lady cop\nHe ran by a tree, there he saw the sister\nShot for the head, he shot back but he missed her\nLooked around good and from expectations\nHe decided he'd head for the subway stations\nBut she was coming and he made a left\nHe was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath\nKnocked an old man down and swore he killed him (sorry)\nThen he made his move to an abandoned building\nRan up the stairs up to the top floor\nOpened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)\nDave the dope fiend shootin' dope\nWho don't know the meaning of water nor soap\nHe said \"I need bullets, hurry up, run!\"\nThe dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun\nHe went outside but there was cops all over\nThen he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova\nRaced up the block doing 83\nCrashed into a tree near university\nEscaped alive though the car was battered\nRat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered\nRan out of bullets and he still had static\nGrabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic\nPointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead\nHe told the cops, \"Back off or honey here's dead\"\nDeep in his heart he knew he was wrong\nSo he let the lady go and he starts to run on\nSirens sounded, he seemed astounded\nBefore long the lil' boy got surrounded\nHe dropped the gun, so went the glory\nAnd this is the way I have end this story\nHe was only seventeen, in a madman's dream\nThe cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream\nThis ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh\nJust another case 'bout the wrong path\nStraight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast\nGood night, knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick\nOh boy, that Uncle Ricky he's really weird (knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick)\nI know right, what did he mean \"Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast\"?\n(knock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick)\nI don't know, I think he be crackin' it up or something (knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em)\nWell, good night (knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)\nGood night\nknock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick\nknock 'em out the box Rick, knock 'em out Rick\n(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)\n(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)\n(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)\n(knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em, knock 'em out Rick)\n(knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick)\n(knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out Rick, knock 'em out the box Rick)\nAnother Vance Wright, Rick the Ruler presentation\nCrumbs!"

Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock, my heart went down south\nSo please, listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...57Embed"

of the week\nWhen I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat\nAn attempt to raise your body heat\nJust blow your mind so that you can't speak\nTo do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet\nAnd let

bank\nSo come on Hank, uh, sing that song\nTo the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong\nWell, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\nAnd when you come inside, into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MCs try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint\nA-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\nI'm gonna rock the mike 'til you can't resist\nEverybody, I say, it goes like this\nWell, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon\nA reporter stopped me for a interview\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter, I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said, \"Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!\nThe Casanova legend must have been true!\"\nI said, \"By the way, baby, what's your name?\"\nSaid, \"I go by the name Lois Lane\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\"\nI said, \"He's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlyin' through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\nI said, \"You need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light?\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm!\"\nI gon' do it, I gon' do it, I gon' do it, do it, do it\nAnd I'm here, and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nJust throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, don't stop y'all\nA-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!\nGo hotel, motel"

Philpot\nHe'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader\nWhat's my DJ's name, (Cut Creator!)\nNow you know the episode who's on the wheels\nHe'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile\nSo precise with a slice that you know he's greater\nWhat's my DJ's name, (Cut Creator!)\nWhat you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed\nI go to the store and get Old Gold\nSo all you crappy lookin' nappy headed girls get back\n'Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked\nRock the bells\nThe bells are circulatin' like the blood in your veins\nWhy are girlies on the tip, (LL's your name)\nCut Creator's (good), Cool J. Is (good-good)\nYou bring the Woodpecker, I'll bring the wood\nThe bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul\nWhy do you like Cool J (it ain't Rock 'N' Roll)\n'Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen\nI'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream\nYou hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense\nIf their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince\nRock the bells\nSo listen to the rhyme the lines, I rhyme on time\nHe'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ Look blind\nSo all you Jheri Curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots\nLike ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop\nAll you gonna-be, wanna-be, when will you learn\nWanna be like Cool J you gotta wait your turn\nSome suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned\nSix G's for twenty minutes is the pay I earn\nI'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze\nDo you like Michael Jackson?

It's like the game ain't the same\nGot younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name\nAnd claim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us\n.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact\nSame niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks\nIn black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked\nSo hold your stash 'til the coke price drop\nI know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock\nAnd if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots\nBut yo, you gotta slide on a vacation\nInside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'\nIt drops deep as it does in my breath\nI never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death\nBeyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined\nI think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind\nYou might also like\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\n\nBe havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's\nMakin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped\nInvestments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks\nWinnin' gunfights with mega-cops\nBut just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger\nMake enough figures until my pockets get bigger\nI ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'\nGive me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'\nThinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter\nWhenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta\nIn the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays\nYoung bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze\nFull of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed\nFrom what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back\nBlack, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black\nThe fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back\nAnd lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\nOr the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes\nI got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane\nLife is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain\nAnd be prosperous, though we live dangerous\nCops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages\nIt's only right that I was born to use mics\nAnd the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes\nI'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow\nMy rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule\nThe smooth criminal on beat breaks\nNever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes\nThe city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps\nThat's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks\nI'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers\nIn the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya\nInhale deep like the words of my breath\nI never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death\nI lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times\nNothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\n\n\"Nasty Nas—\"439Embed"
