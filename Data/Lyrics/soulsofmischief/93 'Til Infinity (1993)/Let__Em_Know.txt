
You're irresponsible, no focus
I hope this advice grips
I ripped it to shreds, I bust heads
With soundwaves and frequencies
Frequently I'm freakin the flows like hoes
At Dancehall shows, rub-a-dub those
Shattering Glass Joes with decibels
To break spectacles, you can't see me
You're feelin' queazy and uneasy
Steppin cautious because you're nauseous
I squashes emcees like I was Colossus
Flippin on Magneto, never metal, without my bending
Ending all existence, my rhymes blending
Niggas up and liquifying, punks are crying
Crews are dying while the mack keeps shining
Gleaming, girls are screaming, 'cause I'm arousing
My styles bring, [?] kids, so hot you lookin drowsy
And drained, refrain from being slain
By my slang, once again I wreck brains

Yo, shit occurs when I shift my words
I dip a Swisher, to my kisser
And get spliffed-a, I riff the
Be the Mista, the abyss the
Widen, 'cause I slide in
Like a titan, mythical
When I grip or pull
Spliff, it will manipulate my brain
In ways to plot or gain
And raises
Tajai is the brand that
Keep it jam-packed
Frankly pretty damn phat
It's over me, I am enough to rip it flat, and pass
The mic to me and see emcees sadden fast
You're ratty, match my tip, you pips
And Gladys Knight gets darkness
Is where we best scar kids
If ours gets bootlegged and sold in the market
Then mark this
Them stands plan to be targets
And I'll stand grand
Then peace to Richmond and
Of course the Land
I'm lettin ya know 'cause I can

"Yeah, I'ma let ya know
Yeah, I'ma let ya know
Yeah, I let you know
Yo, I'm lettin niggas know"

I say that nigga A, that nigga A-K
Can make a nigga day in a very special nigga way
Breaking backs and fists as I smack and diss
Wackness, 'cause they lack this
Phatness, in fact this is
Very booty indeed, prayin you could be freed
From torture or I'll scorch ya with a torch-a
Gasoline, I smash your spleen
I'm quick to blast a fiend
You better jet if ya' ass is keen
Yeah, I got a master plan
I'm faster than Drastic Man
My thing is "Who would blast a friend?"
I only blast wack rhymers
It's time to find ya' own flows
I throw spines and bones
You're ass, extremely ass
You see me pass the senior class
Yo, and now I'm free at last
So let me bust a grill if I must
Making blood spill and your eyes fill with puss
When I bust

Here I go again
Return of the Jedi, red-eye
Use my lightsaber to take guys that pick my flavor
I pounce and trounce on emcees when I slay ya
Remember the days you parleys 'em to the left
'Cause I get deafer than senior citizens with Alzheimer's
And squash rhymers to vapor
Shatter, at a
Forfeiture when I split 'cha
Tore and ripped ya
My orator's quick to concoct a sicker flow
So crawl back under your rock, get off my jock
I'm quicker than minute rice to split and slice
Rappers as I entrapped ya
Slapped ya, with my rapture
On the down low, I trapped your brain
And flips it
Watch the maestro
Slice hoes, entice hoes
As I rip shit
Dip shit, you rap but
Keep your trap shut
'Cause you lack what
Phesto's inducing
I get mood swings!

"Yeah, I'ma let ya know
Yeah, I'ma let ya know
Yeah, I let you know
Now y'all niggas know"
