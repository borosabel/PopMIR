Shootin stars burn burning up in flames
Shootin stars burning up in flames
Shootin stars burn burning up in flames

It's always gotta be a knuckle head startin controversy
Puttin on his makeup to take flicks for the Enquirer
While we entrepreneur these fools startin fire works
Causin scandals and music gimmicks
That's why they're jerks
No originality, no classic material
I be hearin flows sounding so much like the Souls its delirium
But I sit back, don't interfere with them
Stay focused, it's inner energized like a pyramid
We come out while they disappear right quick
In blaze of Hierotechnicalities so exquisite
The Souls of Mischief crew came torpedoing through
Left a crater in the desert with a four mile radius
Others, they just be part of the meteor shower
Heated up for a minute then dissolve in a towering inferno
Every evening you can see them
In the black of the night, spectacular sparks of light
Man I'm seein hella shootin stars like astronomers
While I'm attackin mic I watch them all cremate
The searing heat breaks the fake rapper to molecules
Now all these fools get dynamited
They can't move of breathe
Sounding like eternally extinguished
Didn't learn their fiendish ways
Makes 'em delicate
Fragile like stained glass
I put it down so eloquent
Platinum sellin shit still sports ya but we ever lasting

Shooting stars
Burning up in a flames when they hit the Souls of Mischief atmosphere
Chasing fame
See, they came and went in a millisecond
If you didn't catch 'em, man
They one in the same
It's so mundane
They start off really flashy
But soon then they get axed with the Apache Tomahawk
Slammed to the mat
Superfly stuck a nukka for trying to rap like that
Hook up the microphone from we can scrap

We fit with the muzzle your mind sizzles and bubbles
Uh oh, it's trouble
You get smothered trying to penetrate the ozone layer
Player, you're just another flare in the dark
Fired up like the dragon's lair
You get slayed, you're not the slayer
Dissolving into thin air
Nowhere to be found cause we impair
Taken as rappers who dare to compare
Selling like a share on the Pacific Exchange
But we rip it the same
It's all prepared to slang the pangs through your earphones
You walk on tight ropes trying to engage the fearsome
Unbalanced advancements lead to your last dance with death
Can I hear something
Cause we know he wasn't saying nothing when we steamed 'em up administration by veto
He was like, "That was freestyle? You're my hero"
The mic was on him, and he got shaky and pale
Taking 'bout, "Man, I can't come off the top"
Cause we prevail over the dope fiend scanner brain antics
Mechanic and robotic like a sentinel
Man, we unconventional
We coming so immaculate
Taking niggas dap and shit
You couldn't panic these with a gat and a clip
So stay in the pinch you losers
You ain't equipped
Astral projecting poetics
Quicksilver fast to split your ass to smithereens
You wear the ring, the rig of explosions engulfing your whole scene

He's a shooting star
Burning up in a flames when he hit the Souls of Mischief atmosphere
Chasing fame
See, you came and went in a millisecond
If you didn't catch 'em, man
They one in the same
It's so mundane
They start off really flashy
But soon then they get axed with the Apache Tomahawk
Slammed to the mat
Superfly stuck a nukka for trying to rap like that
Hook up the microphone from we can scrap nigga
