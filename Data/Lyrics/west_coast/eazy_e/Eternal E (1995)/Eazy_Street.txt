About a nigga in the wrong territory

He made a right turn down the wrong street
Now whatta whatta whatta whatta pitty

They say it's niggaz pimpin' 
Gangsta limpin'

But back back to the nitty gritty
Bout this nigga slippin' in my fuckin' city
By the time that he realized that he fucked up
The stupid muthafucka got a foot in his ass
Now this is how the story goes
Don't you ever bring your ass 
In my neiborhood fuckin' my hoes
Cause they my hoes and I knows 
When they've been fucked

"Who's ready to get up and do my thang!"
"Doin' it you know!"

Shoes plad pants and nappy ass hat under
A fucked up hat now lets kick the story

So when people start comin' around
Knockin' at the door sayin' we want more

Rock cocaine yea just as I figured
But he can do that cause he's that nigga
From Eazy Street on the road to riches

Story goes and if the nigga stays up you 
Know he can't be beat all this shit happens
