
Cruisin' down the street in my '64

It's like that and it's like this
I took her to the pad and we started to kiss
Now my dick's on hard ya know what I'm thinkin'
Took her panties off and her pussy was stinkin'
Pulled off my draws and we started to begin
Now the pussy's wet so my dick slides in
Oh, hiddy hiddy hiddy you hoe
Ridin' from the back so I'm fuckin' kinda slow
So fee fie foe fuck fum
She's scratchin' on my back oh here she comes
Now I gotta get a nutt gotta get a nutt gotta get it quick
Ya know because I love this shit so

[Chorus:]
Gimme that, that, that nutt [3x]
Gimme that, Gimme that, Gimme that nutt

Okay back back to the fuckin' basics
You got yours and mine ya want to taste it
Open wide oh no don't you waste it
Oh shit all over ya face kid
Ya know ya know one thing
You know me I like to sling
That dick you know what so roll over girl while I stick it in ya
But I'll turn it wild while I'm ridin' that ass scream and shout
My name is the same
Just another pussy that I had to tame so

uh, get it on baby
uh, get it on baby
uh, get it on baby (lick my balls honey)

[Chorus 2x]

Now I love pussy (love pussy)
And pussy loves me (pussy loves me)
Like a lemon to the lime and the bubble to the bee
Ya know its real good a nigga can't resist it (it's real good)
Couldn't be a foot loop (can't be a fag) so don't get me twisted
'Cause in some pussy is the place to be
Always fuckin' is the life for me
Spread them legs open far and wide
Fuck this shit just let me put my dick inside so

[Chorus 2x]

uh, get it on baby
uh, get it on baby
uh, get it on baby (gently put the ballhaaaaa)

[Chorus 2x]
