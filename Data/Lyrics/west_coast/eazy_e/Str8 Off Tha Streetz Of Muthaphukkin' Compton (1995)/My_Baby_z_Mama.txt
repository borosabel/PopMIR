Sue the daddies for child support. Even though daddy is takin care
Of the baby but the mother's just, you know, scandalous, not
Just like this hey)

Fuck my baby'z mama
The bitch got drama
Fuck my baby'z mama
Coz she's the type o' bitch that wanna see me broke
Broker than a joke, bitch stole my role 
And every time I see the bitch she needs cash
She make me wanna slap her ass
Triflin bitch always got me in a fit
The low-life-Compton-shoppin-swap-me trick
I wanna kill the ho
Then slam her in the trunc of my six fo'
Coz yo, that ho made my dick grow
And now her lawyer's at every show
Waitin for me to kick in my dough
But before I go I'm on death row
Coz the bitch had too much drama...
FUCK MY BABY'Z MAMA !

[CHORUS:]
FUCK MY BABY'Z MAMA ! [7x]
(Trick bitch !)
FUCK MY BABY'Z MAMA !

Fuck my baby'z mama
The bitch got drama
And I'm not the one
I should just knock her punk ass out
While I'm in court payin child support
But then I gotta deal with the father and the steel
And he's the type o' nigga that a nigga's gotta kill
Make me kick up a grip, I don't like her
Coz the bitch is buyin skirts instead of dipers
Beggin so much to hold hands it's startin to look like cuffs
I wish I never fucked
But now it's too late
How much you made ?
Coz accordin to your income
You might have to spend some
Time behind bars
Now ya find it hard
Never thought a bitch would pull a stunt like this
I can't do another day with Pamela
So I'm a pay ya, Anna
But I just like to say...

[CHORUS]

I think of all the money that I spent on a lawyer
I used to be an employer
But now I'm just an employee filin bankruptcy
But now the punk bitch can't touch me
Huh! I only call her to check up on my daughter
So now she's got a restraining order
Put me to the curb and had the nerve to axks a bower or dime
Bitch, you must be outcha rabid ass mind
Huh! Love for start will take much, you see, the bitch broke me
So now I need a crutch
But you gotta understand a judge don't give a fuck
About a young nigga that's down on his luck
So I gotta put the P down and be down for the calls
And give the bitch back her drawers
So if ya drivin by and ya see her
Do me favor, give the bitch the finger
FUCK HER !

[CHORUS]

You biiiiiiiiiitch !!!
