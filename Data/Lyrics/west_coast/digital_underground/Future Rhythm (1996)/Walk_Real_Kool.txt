We're just some fools
And we're rollin'
It takes some fool
Who knows where we're goin'?
We roll real smooth
(Can we go for a ride?)
And even when we're strollin'
(How y'all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will tell me where we're goin?

Now let me me say, "Hello"
Let me put the melody in my flow, cause yo
I'm gonna reach deep in my soul
And flip the story that we all know, but we seldom show
A break from the usual
Silly games and the hoe show, cause bro
It's gonna bring the truth in this video
Spit game like an old pro, girls flow

Now if you got the new BMW and the Rolex, baby don't flex
What's that got to do with you
When your breath smell like brew and you can't figure 9 times 2
No, you can't help anybody
So yo, don't even go there
Cause I read ya
(Cause I read ya)
It's who you are inside
And as a friend will you be there when I need ya?

Fools in the town mackin' and slinging
Jacking old folks, so relentless
It's hard enough being down
But then we got our own folks
Up against us makes us

Just some fools
(Just some fools)
And we're rollin'
It takes some fool
(It takes some fool)
Who knows where we're goin'?
We roll real smooth
And even when we're strollin'
(How y'all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will tell me where we're goin?

Now if I was to go
And get witchu just because you're rollin', in dough
Soon it will show
And that will make me nothing more than a hoe
Baby, don't you know
Real love is bringing out the best in us, for sure
But greedy people are messing up the funk for the rest of us, solo

I can't believe they got us living solo
Make me think my mind is going loco
Better catch eachother cause we're fallin'
I can hear the rubber room is callin'
Who's got the biggest rings, the most gold or the longest hair
Yo, I do not care
I want the freak with the clean teeth (Clean teeth)
An open mind and that treats me kind
So I can rest my mind
The way that everything is going down
It always got me thinkin' always sinkin'
We gotta hang on, gotta live long
Gotta be strong, gotta move on
Can't keep on being

Just some fools
(Just some fools, y'all)
And we're rollin'
It takes some fool
(Fools take a guess)
Who knows where we're goin'?
(How y'all roll, how y'all roll?)
We roll real smooth
But even when we're strollin'
(How y'all walk?)
We walk real cool
Will tell me where we're goin?

Release your mind and let your instincts flow
Release your mind and let the funk flow
Let go of your fears, let your instincts flow
Open up your ears, it's the D-Flo

We're just some fools and we're rollin'
It takes some fool who knows where we're goin'
(Who knows where we're going)
We roll real smooth even when we're strollin'
(Even when we're strollin')
We walk real cool, will tell me where we're goin?
(Somebody tell where we're going, please! Cause I wanna know)
