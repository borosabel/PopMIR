I wanna go up downtown get around town
Out of town for about a month overnight
While the sun's shining bright in the middle
Of the warm cold freezing hot night, that's all

[Money B]

Shake and bake, first take heed the boots and blunder
I'm ready to feel the ninth wonder, ready for it all

[Shock G]

I get the urge I wanna jump can't do it suicide
But I wonder what it's like to fall, cause I want it all

Nuff lah for the session, I want it all

[Shock G]
I wanna have a tight body meet a physically fit girl named Holly
Who likes to ride the bikes exercise and go running
But I also wanna lay around the rest and get blunted

[Humpty Hump]

And a dope biznitch to share the fantasy with me
And live virtually responsibility free, I want it all g

[Shock G]

Get a map flat on the hill drive a Lac
Still I wanna be back down in the hood
So I can chill with the brothers that's from there
You know we're in there I want it all

[Shock G]
I wanna clown with my homies
I wanna do three-sixtys in a â€˜69 Camaro
I wanna drop my clutch tyres scream
Bust a cloud of smoke wreck the scene
And then jet like an arrow
But then again I gotta please the ladies
So I need a clean six-four and a drop-top Mercedes
I want it all
I wanna be as fly as the others, I wanna freak my brothers
With the underground street thing
But then again I wanna make my mother proud
With the Grammy nominee thing
I wanna pleeeaase all my sisters, let me give you the world!
But I can't get Japanese girls out of my system
And I wanna do a grey girl
I wanna live righteous so I might just
Follow Malcolm and kick it like Farrakhan
But then when the lights are gone
I'm out in the street acting crazy
It's great to be alive, I wonder what it's like to die
I wanna live drug free and I wanna be sober
But I wanna get HIGH until the world is over

[Humpty Hump]
I wanna be a real humanitarian
Eat fish and become a vegetarian
But after the party's over at 2am
Then I wanna get a fat burger

[Clee]

I like the day I like the night
I like the dark I like to bite

[Money B]

A kilo and gets some hoes get my stack on attack
And smoke a full tank of [?], I also wanna stop crying

Don't know where I'm coming from
But I know where I'm going
Everything is everything nothing is nothing

And next week I wanna be all alone
