[Verse 1: Shock G]
Mammy, zammy, damn there's nothin to me
but when they rock us in the streets we say "Ooo-we"
you see the freak in the beat, she do me
I hit that mitty-bitty wit the sticky ooo-we gooy
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style
then they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
we got them groceries bro
yo Luniz let go.

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I got the flow so let the Luni man take over
get deep into my hold
if ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole
but it's no original flow
like the Luniz an the man wit the nose.

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo "Good Times" than James Devin glock wars
meanin you critize Tupac for homies in the hood, we strap Rugers an "We Got More".

[Chorus: Shock G]
Didn't ya know
our brothas got more
so check the new flow
cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh.
Look how we throw
a lil sumpthin to roll to
hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O.

[Verse 4: Shock G]
I got that Voodoo runnin through my veins quit
surpressed yes crazy no not insane
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order
I got that dominate gene
so if ya 'noid hide yo daughter
the love ya givin is based on what I do for you
for the right amount of money you probably let me [?] you
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride ain't no whore
don't second guess yo man cuz he got more.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Yukmouth]
Studio gangstas wanna battle, well let's battle
I blasted they plastic ass get put under ground wit the fragments.

[Verse 6: Numskull]
Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor save a gang a neighbors
then move away so they won't be called haters.

[Verse 7: Yukmouth]
Captain Save-A-Hoe
up-up an away ya go
the "O" is too unfadeable.

[Verse 8: Numskull]
But don't trip
get a grip
make ya own skit
be sure
before
you slide through the door cuz "We Got More".

[Chorus x2: Shock G]
Didn't ya know
our brothas got more
so check the new flow
cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh.
Look how we throw
a lil sumpthin to roll to
bump hoes to
from the O-we-O-we-O
