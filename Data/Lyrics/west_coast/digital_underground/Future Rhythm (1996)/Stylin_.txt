It's my style that they like
(Up and down, all around)
It's my style that's alright
(We can do it all night)
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright

My first thought was the ride I be strollin'
On the other hand, baby, bankroll unfoldin'
Or could it be the way I carry myself?
I'm always solo, never need a ho row
On top of things until it's time for me to go low
(Uh-huh) Ladies say I'm sweet like candy
(Oh yeah) Others say I'm rough and rugged
But it's not that way that they always say
Confusing the game that I always play

Huh, ah yeah
(Claiming that they have content, ha, something about their style)
Figure this one out, I don't know

It's my style that they like
(Up and down, all around)
It's my style that's alright
(We can do it all night)
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright
It's my style that they like
(Up and down, all around)
It's my style that's alright
(We can do it all night)
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright

Like Billie Holiday, I gotta pay for them dope notes
Swingin', makin' words sing, slingin' soul like po' folks
I'm stayin' away from all the overworked notes
I'm missin' 'em like prostitutes in heels and fur coats
I'd rather die than not be original, so I keep my music stinky
I keep my lyrical sex kinky
'Cause livin' with no flavor's like a virus in stages
No flavor music makers, stay away 'cause you're contagious
(Face everything) It's remake loopish
(But we're okay) We're cookin' up that lovely soup dish
Some can only flow about them records that you know
But we bring that new swing 'cause we play them things
(Things, things, things) The way you like

(Up and down, all around)
It's my style that's alright
(We can do it all night)
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright
It's my style that they like
(Up and down, all around)
It's my style that's alright
(We can do it all night)
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright

Six-foot-one and dark and lovely, honeys dreamin' of me
So if you think you want, you want that, yo, go, get funny
So don't even lie about the baby givin' action
More Jacksons like my girl likes the rough rhymer's action
So, uh, dilly dally, don't be funkin' 'round on nobody
So check the perpendicular MC, regular
Competitor MC's, you want to be free
So check the MC because you gotta have quality
Massive, our crews and words are off basin'
So check my ill type of flow, girls gotta go
I got more style, baby, so baby, don't you know
Ooh, yeah, gotta have the rapture
Ah, Brooklyn gotta have the rapture
Oh, yeah, Frisco got the rapture
Ah, yeah, Sac got the rapture
Ah, yeah, Oakland got the rapture
Ah, yeah, here we needs action, uh
Haha (That you like)

It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright
It's my style that they like
It's my style that's alright
It's my style that they like
It's my style
