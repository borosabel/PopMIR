Been a public figure for quite a long time
Known to the whole world (for what?) style of rhyme
But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
Although they know, they won't ever get it right

Walk into a party, come smart and laugh
As the girls go crazy, want me for my dear autograph
And it's me they be admiring, my new style of rapping

Had a bunch of small timers, the people on my show
Surround it and bring it with my empty shift
And said um, will you teach us how to rap, no doubt
