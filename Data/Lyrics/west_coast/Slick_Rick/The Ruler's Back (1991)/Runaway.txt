Well, I waited long time sweating it
Getting jerked but yea I'm getting it
Early morning, stiff's the dawnin' of
'Cause a brother give the warnin' of
A new we do we and
Paranoid to near silly and
I said meet me in the lobby skip
So one could cut down on the chubby tip
Alright, he flighty scared
To be in fear to show a mighty that
La Di Da Di wanted Gotti and
Although depending on the body and
Who I know was gonna run away, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be with him, so hallelujah, praise God's King

Check it out, even candle light I figure and
Better handle it my nigga and
I think the best thing is to block her out
'Cause she doesn't give a fuck about
Someone change the choony and
You would of cared to wish the union
She's not a phony, turn the Sony off
You better overcome the lonely of
Although a brother leaden bad
Thus don't know where I'm heading at
You see, 'cause even though we fought a bit
I find that just the very thought of it
When I know she's gonna run away, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be with him, so hallelujah, praise God's King
And I know you're gonna run away, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be with him, can't believe that this is happening

Well, I should say fine phoney gone
Although you say that I'm the only one
But, behind my back's thinking of
Her father not the one I'm thinking of
I'm distrustful what one done to end
Down with this burden here I'm wondering
I know I should say fine fair to ya
And think about all the girls ahead of ya
Though hard for me to just forget her and
Try to follow to the letter end
Although the terrible things we riff about
Her father wise that I can't live without
When I know you're gonna run away, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be with him, so hallelujah, praise God King
When I know you're gonna run away, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be with him, can't believe this is happening
I know you're gonna run away, I know you're gonna be with him
Seems I know you're gonna run away, I know you're gonna be with him
Can't believe this is happening
