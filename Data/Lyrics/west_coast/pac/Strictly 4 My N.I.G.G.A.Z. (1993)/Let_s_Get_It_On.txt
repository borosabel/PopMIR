
Yeah, this is, uh, ha, an untouchable funk
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is for all the players and playettes
Wherever you at, you dig?
I'm talkin' about from this side to that side
East side, west side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky, man, ha-ha

Ayo, give me that microphone
It's Heavy D, the baritone and I'm home alone
Dig it, and I'm always stayin' freshly dipped on 125th
Where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin' spliff

Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah, I'm on your TV screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET
And on your local focal point video show
Nigga, this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels, no weed
But I get love from all the thugs 'cause they still my people
I'm dynamic, punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up
When my mic's hooked up
Let's get it on

Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor
Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor

How shall I plead? Forever thuggin' on a quest to get Gs
Running from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure, the stress will have me drinkin'
Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink

Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' Gs
They after a player but I won't let 'em capture me
I gotta thank the Lord for the weed and the nicotine
I can't sleep, close my eyes and see wicked things

I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger
Rollin' down the 405, beware of strangers
Hand on my .45, that's what the fame does

I'm probably wrong but I'll never know until I'm gone
From out the gutter where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed, let that Hennessy get to me
Before the penitentiary, let's get it on

Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor (Yeah)
Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor

I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do
I have all the honey's saying, "Go Pu'!"
I flip a style from the projects building 70, apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps, rough power amps
And sold weed under corner lamps
But now I'm just microphone-talking
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking

Niggas got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie made in LA, now everybody menaces
But them youth don't trouble we
Because they fall victim to what they see, hey

I keeps it "Reel To Reel", like my last album title song
But I understand, it takes a year for niggas to catch on
Hit 'em in the head, dawg, so let's get it on, yeah

Split the dutches, fill it with the skunk
We about to get wicked in the joint, uh
Notorious is glorious (Uh)

Niggas know who's the mind-blower
The weed's grower, have you seeing doubles like Noah (Uh)
The rhyme flower B.I.G., top-notch
With the Glock, check your pockets and your sockets (Uh, yeah)
It's just the way my pops taught me
When you throw the drop, check 'em thoroughly
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggas don't make no moves
When I'm slinging in the hood, I don't fake no moves
Aight?
Reminiscing on my swinger days (Uh-huh)
When I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves (Oh)

Yeah, she had the Gucci boots
I had Cerruti suits
Oshkosh-begosh, Coca-Cola, lookin' real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representing Bucktown
MAC-11 cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream, earrings (Uh)
You know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on

Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor
Untouchables at your door (Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor
