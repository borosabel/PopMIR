This here's a jam for those who be sexin'
See a girl come up and then you start flexin'
Doin' what you can for the one night stand
But G you gotta see you take your life in your hand
Now it's all well and good that she doesn't ignore you
But did you stop to think who she was with before you?
She's fine so you weren't the first to spot her
And if you do it like Pruitt you're not the first who got her
Maybe Tom, Dick, Harry
Steven, Joe and Barry
John, Paul, George, Ringo, Curly, Moe and Larry
Did it. Got wit it. Smooth hit it
Steady son and like Edison just lit it
But you don't know if that's the case my friend
And you don't want your doctor on your case again
So you better know for sure about the girl before you take a chance
And for now ya better keep it in your pants

Ya know
Ya know
Ya know, bust it
Keep it in your pants, ya know

Now ladies, my story isn't all one sided
Cause I know many of you've confided
In me so I know that I've been trusted
For my words and the moves that I've busted
So, let me see
Let's say a man wants to talk to thee
And you don't want to make a mistake
Cause he could be real or he could be fake
Hmm, think for a minute and use your head
And don't be so quick to hop in bed
It's one thing for you just to giggle and flirt
But why sex a stranger and get your feelins hurt
If he's meant to be with you then he'll stick around
Not just throw you in bed to throw his stick around
Wait and see cause if you really really want romance
Hey, yo, you should keep it in your pants

Ya know
Ya know
Ya know, bust it
Keep it in your pants, ya know

I take my own advice and make the story legit
And I don't wanna be labeled as a hypocrite
I practice what I preach although I'm not preachin'
Just droppin' knowledge to the souls I'm reachin'
Just like when I see my homeboy's girl
And to me she is the flyest thing in the world
It would be easy to tell her I was Young MC
Throw drag and have her go to bed with me
But I'm not the one who gonna live that foul
I'd rather live right than be out on the prowl
And if you're sleepin' wit your homeboy's girl your startin' trouble
Like Freddy sexin' Betty behind the back of Barney Rubble
"Therefore wherefore art thou Romeo,"
Will not work if the girl don't know me though
Say who you are and I'll say who I am
Call it "quid pro quo" like in "Silence of the Lambs"
Now if your friends say,"You should be sleepin' around
Have lot's of sex if you wanna be down."
Hey, be your own boss. Stand tall and strong
Cause you'll be standin' alone if somethin' ever goes wrong
Peer pressure is a hard thing for a child
And acting older don't mean acting wild
And girls, even though it appeals to some men
If you it's true to all of us you better think again
Cause I'm not the kind of guy to get turned on
By a girl that my homeboys can go take turns on
If that was the case, you should be chargin' a fee
And you would probably live larger than me. See
Use your head before you use the covers
Friends are still friends even when they are lovers
And you'll get more respect if you just go dance
Word 'em up and ya keep it in your pants

Ya know
Ya know
Ya know, bust it
Keep it in your pants, ya know
