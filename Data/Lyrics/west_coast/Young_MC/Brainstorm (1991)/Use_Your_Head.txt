Think for a minute and use your head
Think for a minute and use your head
Think for a minute and use your head
Think for a minute and use your head

Chillin' at a club on a Saturday night
You're all dressed up so yo you're lookin' alright
Fly girls all around at least twenty
They're just like candy cause you're the Good and Plenty
One fly girl has got your name on her
She looks so good there's no doubt you want her
So you step to her and you speak your piece
She says, "Hey! How ya doin'? Yeah, my name's Denice"
You talk real slow makin' sure you don't ramble
You're feelin' kinda nervous cause you're takin' a gamble
But Denice is cool, you go out and you dance
She says, "Baby doll I want a night of romance"
So you stop dancin' and head for the door
Wonderin' what the night has in store
You're thinkin' a lot so you walk real slow
There's a condom in your wallet so you're good to go
Now condoms are cool, but they're not the reason
To step to a girl like it's open season
When you check your wallet your jimmy hats gone
Cause last week you gave it to your best friend Shawn
So now you're caught out there with no hat
There's clouds in the sky and you're worried bout that
And acid rain has been a problem this year
Need I say more to make my point quite clear?
Denice don't seem to have a care in the world
You look her up and down and she's a hell of a girl
Nice hair, nice body, nice skin, nice face
And you're all mixed up when you reach your place
Makin' conversation just to entertain
But this girl Denice has got sex on the brain
In the bedroom you're sittin' down on the bed
Now just think for a minute, and use your head

Think for a minute and use your head, word
Think for a minute and use your head, word
Think for a minute and use your head, word
Think for a minute and use your head, kick it
Think for a minute and use your head

All the girls get together for a night of laughs
A slumber party at your good friend Kath's
Kathy's wild, she is somewhat of a freak
And her parents are gone, they're out of town for a week
So everybody's talkin' bout boys and hair
In sleepin' bags, pillows and sheet and chairs
When some of your friends start smokin' that stuff
Because a couple of beers simply wasn't enough
So there you sit in a state of shock
Watchin' powder and straws and pipes and rocks
It comes to you and you pass it on
You feel good about that so the pressures gone
You knew that Kathy was a wild young miss
But you never ever thought that she was wild like this
And as you were thinkin' the stuff came back
You said,"I don't smoke cigarettes so why smoke crack"
Then they start screamin' and callin' you names
Because you wouldn't get high and play the game
You look to your friends for some moral support
But they're too busy with a hit or a snort
Well you wanna be cool, but this ain't right
And you fought with your parents just to spend the night
Now they're lookin' at you and all they see is red
So just think for a minute, and use your head

Think for a minute and use your head, yo
Think for a minute and use your head, yo
Think for a minute and use your head, yo
Think for a minute and use your head, kick it
Think for a minute and use your head

One night after work you all go out for a drink
The job is so rough you're too tired to think
There's five of you, so you take five cars
For five parking spaces when you reach the bar
You order some drinks for the boys to get loose
They all have alcohol and you have orange juice
You have a good time and the five of you speak
About the things that happened at the job last week
Now as the conversation goes on, the alcohol flows on
They're gettin' so drunk your friends can hardly keep their clothes on
And you just chill cause you're bein' polite
But they're havin' more rounds than a Tyson fight
Your friends are drunk and the fear is real
Because you drank so much juice that you're growin' a peel
But you can drive and you can do it wit ease
And right now your friends can't even find their keys
So you take their keys and you put em in your pocket
They get mad, tellin you to stop it
But you say,"No, you're too drunk to drive
And I'll make sure you make it home alive"
The bartender says,"The cars will be okay
And if they're sober they can get em in a couple of days
You know, my friend, you've got a lot of class
Here's a twenty-dollar bill, I wanna pay for the gas"
You get in the car, your friends are screamin' and cursin'
But if you let 'em drive the situation would worsen
And you're doin' somethin' that you think is right
So you'll get 'em home if it takes all night
So one by one you take 'em home to their wives
The good women thank you for savin' their lives
Put 'em in the house and put 'em straight to bed
Because you thought for a minute and you used your head

Think for a minute and use your head, life saver
Think for a minute and use your head, life saver
Think for a minute and use your head, life saver
When I say "Life saver" yo I don't mean candy
Yo
Yo
Yo, think for a minute and use your head
And I'm Audi like [?] see ya!
