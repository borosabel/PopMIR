Bust it

This here's a jam for all the fellas
Trying to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous

Okay smarty
Go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showing body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function
High class luncheon
Food is served, and you're stone-cold munching
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walking
Guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move

You're on a mission and you're wishing
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Looking for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces

From frustration
First inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Now movie's showing,
So you're going
Could care less about the five you're blowing
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sitting in your row

She's dressed in yellow,
She says "Hello.
Come sit next to me you fine fellow."
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next, hey bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
(Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

In this city
Ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way."

Girls are faking
Goodness saking
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Some girls are sadistic,
Materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lying on a beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man

So on the beach you're strolling
Real high rolling
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with something to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
You want it, baby, you got it
(Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
You want it, baby, you got it
(break it down for me fellas)

Your best friend Harry
Has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hoping you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man

You say, "Neat-o,"
Check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinking
Then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feeling really firm 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumping
Bass is pumping
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumping
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do G bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
(Just bust a move)
If you want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it
(Move it, boy)
