[Verse 1:]
attention party people, listen A-P-B,
That is an all points bulletin from Young MC,
now weither you're a senior citizen or just a tyke,
just grab a seat and pay attention while I rock the mic,
I wrote a couple of rhymes, I call 'em 'just say no',
dedicated to the people who are on the go,
and they can help you out if you're on the brink,
and if you listen this jam will make you think,
if you are ever, in a situation,
without enough time for contimplation,
all of your friends go in the same way,
you feel kind of trapped, you don't know what to say,
just say no, 'cause better save than sorry,
this is for real, this ain't no game or foley,
it's your life, and you've only got one,
so you better do it right or it will soon be done,
you want to be popular, you want to be cool,
you want to be the one that everybody likes at school,
you want be everything just for everyone else,
but you better think of what you want to be for yourself,
every day, people livin' in the same old mess,
hard to be original and not be like the rest,
you gotta go for what you know, you can't afford to guess,
and heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes,
so say no

[Chorus:]
Just say no,
do you hear me, say no
just say no

[Verse 2:]
kids O.D. and cause a family greif,
over the marjuiana plant and the coca leaf,
or a bunch of pills,
to try to get their thrills,
over a drug you shoot,
because you think's it cute,
over something you smoke,
man it ain't no joke,
over somethin you drink,
homeboy why don't you think?,
over something you snort like you were playing a sport,
one day you'll go to far and then you'll come up short,
some people out there don't seem to get my point,
telling others crack kills while their smoking a joint,
but the point of this song is to tell you the facts,
some people die from smoking wreffer like they die from crack,
not a drug in particular, but drugs in general,
they're not good for you, like a vitamin or mineral,
they come in liquid, leaves, powder, pills and rocks,
can put you six feet under on your back in a box,
so say no

[Chorus]
