'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop

That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you
(Tick tock, you don't stop)
That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you
('Til the tick tock, you don't stop)

Hammer, Hammer's rolling with a rhythm
That sold many mills, now skills is what I give 'em
I got the dance steps, catch it pumpin' in your boombox
The tracks are nothing less than phat now
Feel the vibe of the vibe while I'm doing my thing
It's on, so don't be telling them it ain't on
Hammer, phat, right and exact
'Cause I'm like that, you might whet that so don't sweat that

Yo, tell me who got the props (I got the props)
Tell me, who's got the loot? (Hammer got lots)
Crazy dough, Luciano
Cool fellow with a flow mellow with the piano
Yeah, now feel the funk that I bring
That Oaktown swing, everything that I drop (Proper)
Now the song that I drop hit the top 'cause it's pop
Then it's like that and you don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)
(Don't stop)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do ('Til the tick tock, you don't stop)

That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you
That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you

Here we go again
With another song from the Hammer that's hittin'
Another don't stop and don't quittin'
Smoothing 'em out, blowing 'em like a storm
Coming from the man with one head, two legs, chest and arms
Who's the first to doing the judging?
I ain't budging, you guys wanna rush it but you can't touch it
I keep on tryin' to tell y'all
You keep dissing and dissing and dissing but I don't fall

Yo, tell me who got the props (I got the props)
Tell me, who's got the loot? (Hammer got lots)
Crazy dough, Luciano
Cool fellow with a flow mellow with the piano
Yeah, now feel the funk that I bring
That Oaktown swing, everything that I drop (Proper)
Now the song that I drop hit the top 'cause it's pop
Then it's like that and you don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Don't stop)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)

That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you
That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you
Tick tock, you don't stop

'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop

Bust it, I don't fake the funk, I make the funk
That makes you bounce with the beast and shake your trunk
And you can't stop it and you can't knock it
'Cause I skyrocket like a rocket
They holler, "Hammer, don't hurt 'em"
Well, I'ma do it anyways
So give me the flow and watch me work 'em
With a shake of the leg, I get spade
And it's like if you could test the grade
I'll be an A, fat

Yo, tell me who got the props (I got the props)
Tell me, who's got the loot? (Hammer got lots)
Crazy dough, Luciano
Cool fellow with a flow mellow with the piano
Yeah, now feel the funk that I bring
That Oaktown swing, everything that I drop (Proper)
Now the song that I drop hit the top 'cause it's pop
Then it's like that and you don't stop

Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)
(Don't stop)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)

Don't stop 'til you get enough (Don't stop)
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)
(Don't stop)
Don't stop 'til you get enough (Don't stop)
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)

Don't stop 'til you get enough (Don't stop)
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
If it's good to you
Do what you wanna do (Tick tock, you don't stop)

That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you (Tick tock, you don't stop)
That OG funk, that's what it is
Hammer bringing it to you

Tick tock, you don't stop
Tick tock, you don't stop
Tick tock, you don't stop
'Til the tick tock, you don't stop
Tick tock, you don't stop
Tick tock, you don't stop
