It's been a real long week, you're hurting your feet
The enemy is screaming 'defeat, defeat'
It's tough to bear, and trouble's everywhere
At times it seems like nobody cares
He may not come when you call him
But he's always there when you need him
He's cold in effect
And I know no clown could never ever beat him

Life ain't as bad as it may seem
When you're the son of the king
When you're the son of the king
Oh, let my choir sing
Take us higher

Now, here's a little story I got to tell
About two phony preachers on their way to hell
One sells rags, and calls them a blessing
And if you buy 'em you'll cold learn a lesson
Another sits in towers, hours and hours
Can you tell me, does this man have the power
Of the spirit, that is freely given
It's for the money this man is living

You can't buy in, if you know what I mean
To be the son of the king
Let my choir sing

I'm so tired, and yet so fired up
You lie to his people
What a shame that you do, what you do
I believe in him, and not in you
I trust in his word, and have you heard
You just want the money, that's to the curb
The more that you need, the more you want
[?]

Money ain't worth losing your dream
When you're the son of the king
Oh, choir, sing for me

Now I know, little old miracles, they come true
Source in our prayer [?] through
God bless the child [?] own
The thief, the liar, the list goes on
Forgive all the preachers who are lost
Who charge for your word, it don't cost
Me nothing but time, to kneel and pray
Bless all my brothers and sisters [?]

Life ain't as bad as it may seem
When you're the son of the king
When you're the son of the king
Oh, sing, choir
Ah yeah
I feel it
