Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper (break it down)
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper

How we need it how
We achieve it first, we get knowledge then
We abolish ignorance in our people then
We go deeper, this is a thought that I bring, so think with the music and sing
Ooooooooo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo, think with the music and sing, yeah ooooooo

Oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo
Take them to the hole

Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper

Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper (break it down)

Any man next to me, no matter who or what
We could be here, from there colorblind so

Scientific is the formula
Thinking like that, they own you
Rock stops and bell

Then your problem, you flush or flail
In your thoughts, you've been bought
And generations, we made a cost, this is a thought that I bring, so think with the
Music and sing
Ooooooooo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo, think with the music and sing, yeah ooooooo oo
Oo oo oo oo oo ooooo
Yo! We at the hole, hit it
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper (break it down)
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper

Money (money) is power
Now is the hour to, make a move
Sleeping dogs, they don't move, they lie, steal
We know how to go deeper, in time

Money yo, it change minds
Ooooooooo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo, think with the music and sing, yeah ooooooo
Oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo
Yo! We at the hole, hit it
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper

Poverty a tradition
Stuck is our condition
Learn, from having welfare your son gotta have it

Others, just choose so I was and booze
I hate that we lose, to crack dope is a rule
Ooooooooo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo, think with the music and sing, yeah ooooooo
Oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo
Yo! We back at the hole, hit it
Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper (break it down)

Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper
Elevate yo mind
Pull and climb higher
Increase your desire, to obtain knowledge
Is fame wrapped up, and done
You, you be the one
Ooooooooo oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo, think with the music and sing, yeah ooooooo
Oo oo oo oo oo oo ooooo
Man, we back at the hole again

Let's go deeper, we wanna go deeper
Let's go deeper, we gotta go deeper
