How did we get from the top of the world to the bottom of the heap?
I don't recall you mentionin' the boss is such a creep
We still have the ingrdients to make this summer sweet
(Well) I got rags instead of riches
And all these dirty dishes
Just wish I had three wishes
(Okay, guys, break it up)

We've got to work, work to work this out
We'll make things right; the sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out

(Dude, what have you gotten us into?)
(Come on, we can totally turn this thing around)
I'd rather face a seven footer straight up in the post
That sure beats hangin' here
And burnin' someone's toast
I needed Banjamins, but this ain't woth the stress
Maybe there's a better way to fix this greasy mess
We're a champion team
A well-oiled machine
And we faced tougher problems than this
I know it's a grind
But I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun while we get this job done
We've got to work, work to work this out

We'll make things right; the sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer

If we work this out
Let's work it
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of butter
It's the pefect recipe
Pay day!
It'll taste so sweet
Pay day!
Good enough to eat
Gonna make some motion pictures
Hit the mall with all my sisters
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers
Kick it with the music mixers
Buy a ride that suits my style
Lounge around the pool a while
Make a date with my fa'rite girl
We've got it made

Whoa!
We've got to work, work to work this out
We'll make things right; the sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
Work this
Gotta work this
We can work this out!
