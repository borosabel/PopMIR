That sultry funk
That's the type of funk I want
VMF and the Hammer with that sultry funk (sultry funk)

Since "we like the funk"
Always come with the flows you can't touch, known to get the crowd pumped (Right)
And I'm tight, sharp as a dagger dropping bombs on the fools climbing charts like a ladder
And they just can't understand, when they see me flow, wanna be me
Know what I was raised up from (I'm from the ESO)
Tracks I always shine like a medallion (So When I start to flow)
I ride the beat like a stallion
Gots to be the man getting twenty bucks a head
Full arena, with fifty million dizzles and a big ol' Benz
I'm on a hitlist ('bout to blow up)
Suckas said I showed up, can I get a witness? (Sho' nuff)
You see the funk is just in me, that's why they talking bad
I got the style that make them jealous, starts envy
They never made me none, now everybody sayin' (Where'd you get your funk from?)

Viscous man funk introduce daygo town represent
West coast battle lyricist, this is how it's meant to be run
Got that funker slang like yayo
This here is my say so, got you fiendin' for this funk you just can't say no
Time to sow it up, this is a daygo take over
Choppin' grassy bustas up like my middle name was lawnmower
Hip-hop to the fullest, do not care what you say or think
Frontin' on the funk, then plug your nose
It stinks
Sultry Funk is what I call my style of music
Sultry meaning sensual or real rich you choose it
The incognito man is out the closet doing the big-strut
Guys cannot front it
Girls, go ahead and shake that butt
Here is something you can't understand
VMF even on dance track, got the master plan to take
Hip-hop to a new level with riddles in every song
Put that blunt down and take a hit of this sultry funk bong

If you want trees from, we know that you need some
We got it by the bag-full so why don't you come and get some
Viscous man funk and the hammer went and did it
Bounced into the lab and we got (sick wit it)

(We got the funk that we know you need)
(So why don't you come and get a little bit of sultry)

I come in straight from daygo and flossing with mo-town
That sultry funk sound
Anyone who try to diss is getting clowned
VMF, LAZ, and Cricket
The new entity joined forces with Hammer to fame pretended be
Yeah
Now we got this funk, it's unusual but different
(Everybody party, ain't nobody's set trippin')
This funk it don't make you wanna sit down
(Every time you hear it all you wanna do is get down)
I'm coming with the real, so bump this in your trunk
This'll hold you for awhile till the next sultry funk
