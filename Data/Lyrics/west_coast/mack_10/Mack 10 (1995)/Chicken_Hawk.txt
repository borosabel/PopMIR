Quielty I stalk niggas call me the Chicken Hawk
Approach with my gun in a 2 one one 
As I sickum lay my victum may I lickum
All action stop nobody move no pop
As I reck shop red alert make yo blood squirt
When I work in the brownies and the high top chucks to do dirt
Keep it sound put it down my way
Protected by an A.K. as I search for my pray
Through the geto hit the peddle every corner I'm torning
Look for the money the kilos and the gallons of shermin nigga
Till we meet I stash my heat
Neet in my baggage do damage nasty as a savage
Lookin for the cabbage
Its own 20 grand I spot a bird in hand
As I spread my wing spand I swoop ready to land
Gotta get heem hit the spot grab the sack
And I shake it blessed with the game
To make it bus its easier to take it, nigga

[Ice Cube]
I'm a chicken hawk huntin for a chicken
Stickin', my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga
I'm a chicken hawk huntin for a chicken
Stickin', my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga
"Don't make me kill everybody on this motherfucker"

[Mack 10]
On a late night creep the hawk sours on a mission
Mashin' through the hood nerd this nigga had the chickens
36 zones in each sack to be exact
Got 50 G's or more in street value worth of crack
As he put it down out of control with the cavey
Got Benzos on the grass twistin front and back cadeys
Capacino sted of coffe moet
No more rossie rolex diamonds all glossy
Glossy Mr. Flossy sewed up the block keys to double up rock
I gotta lick heem nigga want know heen when I get heem me
Shoot strate never hesitate fools cooperate
Or I dag un tagum body bagum with my magnum
Heat in yo chest how we do it in the west 
I gaffle up yo dope and fly back to my nest
I stalk hit up in chalk all over the sidewalk
Its Mack 10 foe life better know as the chicken hawk

[Interlude:]
[Man] Allo
[Mack 10]
Yeah nigga, I got yo bitch, so take all the [?] you got
And put on [?] behind the [?] or I kill this motherfucker
[Girl] Fuck this nigga don't give any shit
[Mack 10] Bitch shut the fuck up right now

[Mack 10]
On a midnight flight the hawk glides through the breeze
Pull my wings at eaze as I lands in the palm trees
Overlook my lick set my scope like a sniper
Hawk the bitch piper be alarmed foe the type a fool
That ah hoo ride when he doo ride
I came ruff out the box Inglewood school of hard nots, nigga
A gaffle dick is all I ever gave a hoe
Where peneltons not a cape so I can't save a hoe
Mack 10 just stepped off the planet of the apes
Foe the money and dope I never rapes I duck tapes
Bitches I mackum down flagum down they pull over
Fill lucky as a fowe leaf clover in a Range Rover
They never know its the hawk his self
My eyes reder than red with St. Ides on my breff
I draw down all this licken got me nervous so I'm twitchen
Bitch two to the dome or take me to yo nigga chickens

[Ice Cube]
I'm a chicken hawk huntin for a chicken
Stickin', my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga
I'm a chicken hawk huntin for a chicken
Stickin', my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga
Foe life
