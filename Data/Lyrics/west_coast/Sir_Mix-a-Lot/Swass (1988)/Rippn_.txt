[Verse 1]
Got a real fine freak with a real big butt
She gets real ill when she hears my cut
Got two Cadillac's one blue, one gold
With straps on the back one fresh with a folds
Grill in the back with a grill in the front
24-carrot gold on my trunk
Got a rope like a python hanging 'round my neck
Got a freak in my arms cold kicking on the set
Never get ill coz I'm too damn swatz
Got a funky Trans-Am with a duel exhaust
LA is fine but Seattle is my home
Ornament is good coz I don't like chrome

[Chorus x2]
That's rippin'

[Verse 2]
Chillin' never illin' in the place to be
Down with MIX-A-LOT
On the west coast driving big Cadillac's
Snow-white paint job with the wheel in the back
?sex talks smack if they cannot aim?
But you gotta have a brand in the computerised game
You get mad coz your girlfriend wants to play my song
You know you wanna hear "Put The Record Back On"

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm a real estate investor a hardcore dresser
Money counting brother and I hate polyester
Walking on the wild side pulling gold snaps
I know you getting jealous because I got it like that
Cruise by the way on my cellular phone
Spend a hundred thousand dollars on a brand new home
Dog in the front yard fence in the back
Freak round the side with a feline hat

[Chorus x1]

Rip This

[Verse 3]
Rolling with a new song kicking my beats
With my girl by my side looking oh so sweet
Got ? on my feet and gold on my neck
Hardcore carrot cash and I never write cheques
Bank roll so sweet I can hardly hold it
You once had a dream that you grandma stole it
Punched her in the eye and took my bank back
You ever wonder why I'm like that

Coz I'm rippin'
And that's rippin'

[Verse 4]
Yeeaahh... 
You like this beat but its time to change
Not gonna get ill but I'm gonna get strange
Push your partner throw 'em in the eye
Gonna kick it live with the "Square Dance" style

I'm a rippin' motherfucker that my last name
When I get wild freaks go insane
Rip it to the left and a rip it to the right
Gonna bust hardcore on my freaks tonight
Grab your partner get up in his face
Homegirl put the sucker in his place
Seven days a week I'm on vacation
Lets get live with the kid sensation

[Beatboxing]

[Instrumental Chorus: x2]

[Verse 5]
Can I get ill just one more time
Kid Sensation with a new fresh rhyme
All the fly chicks hanging on our tip
Keep the girlies come with my bullwhip
All sucker DJ's I will swat
Call ill hip-hop with Mix-A-Lot
There's girls that will dance and girls that wont
Because this jam rips and other ones don't

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 6]
Rollin' down the avenue picking up points
I like to count bank but I don't roll joints
I'm a hardcore B-Boy sitting on a throne
Never hanging on a ave' just kick it at home
Girlies at Cal like to feel my beats
Big, big kick drums get more freaks
Some sucker MC's say "they can feel it"
But I bet you be happy if I let you steal it

[Chorus x3]
