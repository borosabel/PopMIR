Run for the hills cause the mack is back
I'm hookin' up girls by fact
If you're stacked 
You can rub a big mack
I gotta gas 
So don't worry about scraps 
(no, no)
Five foot eleven with a seven foot game
Gotta big mouth piece and I show no shame
Monster kinky have no morals
Monster loves to get oral (ummmm!)
Got ten cars and the girls like that
I was born and bred to be a mack
Once your sign is played 
You gotta put a style in your game now a days
In the sixty's girls was all hot 
LSD had 'em given up thigh
The baby boom was on I drop
No more woodstock but now you got Mix-A-Lot
So put me in your CD changer
Watch your girl cause Mix's a re-arranger
Ooo, he's sexist 
Doo, he's sexist 
Keepin Rush Limbaugh restless
Well I'm da' mack and that’s monster
Straight chase girls through the tail cause I wants to
You can call it wack
But you respect this black 
When it comes to game I'm a monster mack

[Chorus:]
Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Big Mack, Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm a monster mack
Lookin for sex
Bih bih bih big big mack

Strike the pose
But she aint nasty as me
Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky 
Can't stop tappin that tweety 
Give it to the needy
Nope, cause I'm too damn greedy
Here I go walking through the mall
Don't play ball
But I got game for 'em all
Focus on a victim, Focus on a victim
Mr. Richard is hot so lets sick em
And like a tomahawk jumpin’’ on a skillet
Girl you got to gimp my puhh
The pick up king is back buddy 
Tryin’ to give lessons to these thick ass ballers and understudies
I'm not tryin’ to call you no bitch girl
Don't give a damn if your poor or rich girl
And we can play a pool
And I'm pokin’ that 8-ball cool
And the bootys
I still like the bootys
She got a little waist doin’ squats just to keep me on my duty
Giant size games what I droppin’
Straight freaks with these thick ol' gluts is what I'm knockin’
Now the right wing wanna test me 
If likin’ sex is a crime then you arrest me
But don't tell me who to sing to Jack 
Cause a third of your life is in the sack
I'm a monster mack

[Chorus]

Drivin’ my car by the bus stop
Till I spot a young cutie straight suckin’ down a soda pop
Baby girl's winkin’
Mix-A-Lot's thinkin’
Hope this girl's feet ain’t stankin’
Here we go 
Swing by Franglors
Get a little Soul Food
Now you got a brother in the mood
Damn gotta get her home with the quickness
For this warriors a witness
No need to put my girls on tilt
Cause straight up game will get your milk
The nasty dog is back 
With straight pimp game black
Ain’t no shame 
I'm a monster mack

[Chorus]
