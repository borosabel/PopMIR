Just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
Yeah

Here we go, fee fi fo
A giant-size negro, checkin' mo' bank roll
Smooth with the pimpin', the system is the hoe
Ain't no simpin' in me, it's just da pimpin' in me
Used to buck a [?], now I'm rollin' in a six-oh-oh
Big skedan on plush Renzo's
Cops jock when I cruise around blocks
'Cause they think I got rocks
The cops got my name on file
They wanna get wild
'Cause I'm rollin' in style
Peak game, listen to a mack drop hits 'bout a new type of pimp
My hoe wears red, white, and blue
Always on TV tryna be a hoe for you
The system used to go up in me
But now they wanna send me to the pimp, G
It's just the pimpin' in me

Just da pimpin' in me (Haha)
It's just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
(Straight pimpin')
Just da pimpin' in me
It's just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me

To my enemies, big bank take little, baby
Lookin' kinda hard but your beat's ain't
Tryna ride my jock to get paid
Fool I'ma tell you why you can't fade
It's just da pimpin' in me
It's like that, nigga, jump up on the bandwagon
Taste a name, and keep naggin'
And I'ma still keep you suckas on chuck
While I make another two or three million bucks
'Cause it's the pimpin' in me
You wanna talk about props while you ride my jock
But you can't knock my paycheck, hops
Back-to-back conflict's on wax ain't jack
'Cause I got contracts for contacts
Your lyrical content is moot
'Cause big mouth niggas don't shoot
You tried to diss to get juice
But I got the loot, the loot, the loot
(Do you want it?)
Pimpin' ain't easy, your contract's queasy
Your manager is jokin' so you blame me
And while you're rollin' in your girlfriend's car
Fool, I'm buckin' this turbo off
'Cause it's the pimpin' in me

Just da pimpin' in me (Yeah)
It's just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
(Ain't no simpin' in this pimpin', fool)
Just da pimpin' in me
It's just da pimpin' in me

Straight pimpin', but I ain't the one to start livin'
'Cause it ain't the kinda pimpin' Mix-a-Lot is givin'
The system is built on greed
And you got the need, so feed the greed to be free
Yeah, come on down and get your pimpin' right
A [?] got a mall uptight
Stiff about my grits, so don't try to be swift and lift
'Cause mercury tips, hit
I got game, I never gave a damn about fame
Just as long as my check came
Nineteen [?] raised me, [?] 1983
Put the pimpin' in me
Criticized 'cause I got about fifteen cars
I don't break laws, so why you on my draws
Much green, five mil' mode and y'all frontin' ass niggas
Sayin' it's just the pimpin' in me

Just da pimpin' in me (Aha)
It's just da pimpin' in me
Just da pimpin' in me
(Straight pimpin')
Just da pimpin' in me (Whada, whuh whuh whuh wha?)
Just da pimpin' in me (Aha)
Just da pimpin' in me
