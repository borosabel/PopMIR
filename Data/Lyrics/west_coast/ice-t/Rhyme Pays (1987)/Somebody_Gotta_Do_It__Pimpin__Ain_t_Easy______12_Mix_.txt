[Verse 1: Ice-T]
My lifestyle is crazy, I'm luxury lazy
So much gold; that jewelry don't faze me
Cordless phone, eight or nine homes
Girlies on my Jammie with an Ice-T Jones
Bank account booming, fast lane zooming
Known around the world for my high post grooming
Macks like a preacher, loves like a teacher
Got a girl lives in Paris, when I want her I beep her
Too many clothes, got a rag top Rolls
1.000 Watt System, and my speakers are BoseÂ®
I kick it like a champ, I throught you knew it
Though pimping ain't easy; but somebody gotta do it

[Interlude #1:]
[Emanon] Yo Ice, they want you to be on Lifestyle for Rich and Famous
[Ice-T:] Man, hang up on that fool!
[Emanon] Yo Ice, what you're doing with that fourth cord on the floor
[Ice-T:] Homeboy, that's the carpet man!
[Emanon] Yo man, what you're doing with all this money, all over this floor man?
[Ice-T:] Get the vaccum, dude!
[Emanon] Yo man, there's ten girls waiting in the bedroom
[Ice-T:] They been there for a week, another day won't hurt!

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
My thumbs are tired, just from counting cash
No more room in my diamond stash
Filing my nails is such a tiring task
Gold knobs in my Benzo dash
Five freaks just to comb my hair
Monograms on my underwear
Bodyguards around so please don't dare
You're taking a chance, if you just stop and stare
Living my life is just so hard to do
Making deals, a million one or two
Buying new cars for my entire crew
Matching Ferraris, E's black, mine is blue
Can't swing a lap in my pool because it's just too long
Could never go broke because my bank is too strong
No matter what I do, I simply can't go wrong
And I'll make money, I don't need this damned song
But somebody's gotta do it

[Interlude #2:]
[Emanon] You want this rope, but that go one ten thousand one's twenty
[Ice-T:] Yo, I don't care man, put it on the dog man!
[Emanon] Yo Ice, what you're gonna do, we got a house on Parsberg, half built
[Ice-T:] Man, I don't like it no more, tear it down, I don't need no more houses!
[Emanon] Yo Ice, Gucci, Louie and Fila wanna sponser you
[Ice-T:] Man, I told you, I don't need no more clothes
[Emanon] Man!!

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
When I walk in a joint, punks always look at me hard
Because I wear enough gold to tie a dog in a yard
Cold maxing in my mansion, so big it's silly
Got a butler named Humphry and a maid named Milly
Mink sheets on my bed, that's what I said
Gourmet chefs in my kitchen so that I can get fed
So tired of sailing on my boat I might.. 
just Helicopter to my Jet and catch a midnight flight
So many girls in my book, it weighs a ton
Gotta leave the damned country just to have some fun
Private suite at the track to watch the ponies run
And there ain't nothing in the world that me and E ain't done
But somedody's gotta do it

[Outro:]
[Emanon] Yo Ice, it's Brandal Rays man, he wants to know can he hang out with you and E
[Ice-T:] Man, would you tell that fool! to get off my jamie man
[Emanon] Yo yo yo Ice, your homeboy at Marker Show just caught up, wants to borrow some more money
[Ice-T:] No Problem! small thing to a gaint, cause somedody gotta do it!!
