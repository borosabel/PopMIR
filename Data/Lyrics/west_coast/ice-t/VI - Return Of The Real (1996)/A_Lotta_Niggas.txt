[Sean E. Sean] Yo, what up my nigga Ice?

[Ice-T] Yo, what's up Sean E. Sean? how you're living, baby?

[Sean E. Sean] 
Yo man, cool it up
You know, it ain't me man, but a lot of niggaz, man
It ain't me, a lot of niggaz is saying, man
You went out, doing the movies, you know
You got the BC, Rock & Roll band, you know
You supposed to be Ice-T - O.G. - Hip-Hop

[Ice-T]
Yo, yo, check this out man! 
A lot of niggaz don't know what a DI blow is
Is that mean I don't want one?
A lot of niggaz got lot to say about Rap
But ain't never grabbed the mic and rocked one goddamn show
A lot of niggaz still on the street cause they worried about 
what a lot of niggaz would say if they go out and get a job
I've never ran with a lot of niggaz
I only ran with the Real Niggaz, you know what I'm saying?
And if you ain't willing to do shit your way
Then you have to copy a lot of niggaz, and that copy can't be real
It could only be counterfeit
And a lot of niggaz had never figure that shit out
Yo, I'm out here man, Peace!

[Sean E. Sean]
Word! man
FUCK them bitch ass niggaz!
