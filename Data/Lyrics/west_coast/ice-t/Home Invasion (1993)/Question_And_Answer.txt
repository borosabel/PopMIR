What is a rapper doing when he starts out hardcore
But can't sell enough records to remain in the record business?
Answer: He goes Pop!
This answer is not set up to dis anybody who starts out Pop
But for the rappers who started out hardcore
And now making weak ass Dance Music
Cause they couldn't stay down with the hardcore
I just got a question for you;
How does it feel to wake up every morning
And look in the mirror and realize that you're a fucking whore?
