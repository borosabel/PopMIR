[Kurupt:]
Well, it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
See these other fools, but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I? (It's Kurupt, motherfucker!)
Do or die (We gives a fuck, motherfucker!)
So slow yo' roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna
'Cause I'm gonna grab my strap then clear the corner, bitch!!

[Dat Nigga Daz & Lil' Malik:]
To all my bitches and my niggas, and my niggas and my bitches
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave yo' motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' hands in the air

[Dat Nigga Daz:]
Now, on a one (one), two (two), three (three), who could it be?
Comin' wit' a grip of gangsta shit for '93
So '94's arrived, nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now, can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around, 'cause ain't shit for sale
In the Coupe wit' the beat, flossin' off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for Tha Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In yo' ass, for gettin' us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a callin' for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
(Yes, y'all) other Doggs, (Yes, y'all) Yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice, and have a ball

[Kurupt:]
I packs a strap like that, I kicks it like this
Now, how many bitches must get dicked?
Befo' they say, "Oh, that is that nigga from back in the day
I never, ever thought I'd see him bustin' with Dr. Dre"
'Cause I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin' to my flat so I can tap that ass

[Dat Nigga Daz & Lil' Malik:]
To all my bitches and my niggas, and my niggas and my bitches
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave yo' motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches, and my bitches and my niggas
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air

[Kurupt (Dat Nigga Daz):]
You're headed my way, nigga, you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin'? I'm cappin' shit up like a Western flick
The kingpin of the clique, top notch
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop!
The run of the mill, fool get broke off for tryin' to serve the best
Kurupt's era, peep the terror, 'cause it's a murder fest!
I smoke chronic every day, so what have we?
Another motherfucker gettin' served like some cavi
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes), I got the Juice like 2Pac
(Plus I'm..) rollin' wit' two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin' like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin' shit the fuck up!
Slow yo' roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin'? Rakim never joked, so why should I, loc?
And that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin' 'em like Flo Jo, Stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die 'cause I'm servin'
And they can't fuck wit' or see me, I'm mass-murderous
(Smokin' indo, look out my window I suppose) Yeah
(Niggas don't understand how we kicks different flows
I'm raw like news footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
(Bring yo' whole set and get yo' hood lynched)
(Drop to yo' knees like a dog in heat)
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques

[Dat Nigga Daz & Lil' Malik:]
To all my bitches and my niggas, and my niggas and my bitches
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep yo' motherfuckin' fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep yo' motherfuckin' fingers in the air

[Lady of Rage:]
Check it out, it's Rage! Ready for the breakdown, take down
When it comes to the mic, I'm puttin' my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm Stranded on Death Row wit' nowhere to go
So, what's a girl to do?
Take out a crew or two, a few, what you wanna do?

[Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound:]
Throw yo' guns in the motherfucking air, we don't care
(Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga!)
About nothin' at all, just my Doggs and clocking the grip', bitch!
(Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga!)
That's why I can kick it so tuff, 'cause when times get ruff, my
(Niggas don't give a fuck, nigga!)
The clique that I'm wit' don't give a shit, ya know why?
(Real niggas don't give a fuck!)

[Dat Nigga Daz:]
Now all the bitches, and the niggas
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave yo'our motherfucking hands in the air
To all my niggas, and my bitches
Wave yo' motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep yo' motherfuckin' fingers in the air
