I'mma let it be known
That I'm with the foe so nigga you know it's on
Oil my chrome 'cause I got murder in my blood and in my chromosome
For the fact that I take none, pack a gun in my dang-a-lang
That nigga that nigga that gang bang no never that nigga that claim
Yeah, I'm a nigga eating Jesus brains
I got the evil in my muthafuckin back and in my muthafuckin veins
Wearing my black to creep
Mamma told a muthafucka he'd be dead in a week
So nigga what? Load me like a tre five sev
Pass the dank taking dead body's to the blood bank
And while I hook em up proper
I got them swallowing in my loaded heart stopper
Pop! Pop! The trigga fiend, the niggas spleen
Plus the barrel on my muthafuckin nine, looking plus
That nigga that nigga that runs them mothafuckas back
I got you fiendin for a nigga like you fiend for crack
'Cause it's like that (more wiggita than a nigga get might packed???)
'Cause in the 4 you know never know you better gat right back
So niggas know us brothas can't go out like that
Selling my mamma the crack, watch yo back 'cause (You know I had to gat ya)

(Yeah, you know I had to gat ya)
(187 on a) (nigga)
(Yeah, you know I had to gat ya)
(187 on a) (nigga)

Yeah, picture your death
That nigga that sickness
Figure to sick this, foo
That nigga that rips
The wickedest look at that nigga that sickness drops
And as my trigga goes Pop! Pop! Pop!
That niggas be ducking from the buck shot
See, fuck it when the gat drops, you know it's in a hoes cot
So there it goes, not the average nigga
The baby killa, the rabies dealer
Dealing that nigga maybe killing that nigga that smooth way
That mothafuckas ain't shit to me
White nigga, black trigga cracks every mothafuckas back
Way in the day, fools used to get they squabs on
The Blood gang, Deuce-Nine, Creek Mobb zone
Running a mothafucka like a pitbull, loading up that clip tool
But stealing on muthafuckas like a clepto
Let no, other muthafuckas raid the hood
Half the mothafuckas smoking niggas like wood
Got locked up with they cock up, some other niggas asshole
But at least my niggas had enough heart to blast though
Now the deuce ain't deep like 86
I'm solo, might as well pin me on a crucifix
The deuce-fo' age, baby killing atheist
For the funk right back, 'cause (You know I had to gat ya)

(Yeah, you know I had to gat ya)
(187 on a) (nigga)

Same old fool, that nigga deep load, what up
Ain't no doubt who runs the muthafucka
'Cause every cut I drop is like a muthafuckin main course
Hella niggas eat that's why I make so many corpse
'Cause when they hear that nigga that nigga that sickness drop
My nine millimeter goes Pop!
My sign going to creep them
Nightmare creeper millimeter meter
Lock up, main corpse, spirit your brain
Got niggas killing niggas, just because I'm rapping insane
Something like a Manson mind, my nigga Triple Sicx
(I got em doing a devil dance of mine)
Leaving em only one chance to die and niggas wanna used a Glock
Niggas wanna go to heaven but don't want to get shot down
Yeah, with my .38 snub nose
I got niggas crawling to me trying to pack me for the hella holes
Letting loose like Antonio Montana
With a Uzi and I'm kicking em with a 12 gauge Moss'
And I'm off, psycho like I'm Michael Myers part six
Brotha Lynch, ripping his arms off up the crucifix
And when I grab my 9 millimeter gun, puttin' it to your back
'Cause I don't know how to act so (You know I had 2 gat ya)

(Yeah, you know I had to gat ya)
(187 on a) (nigga)
(Yeah, you know I had to gat ya)
(187 on a) (nigga)

(You know I had 2 gat ya)
