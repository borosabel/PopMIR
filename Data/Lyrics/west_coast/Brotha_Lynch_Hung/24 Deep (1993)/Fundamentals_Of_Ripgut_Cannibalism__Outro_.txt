[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Who the fuck are you?

[Devil:]
Just call me Manson, some people say I'm the Devil
And I'm coming to you because I heard you were atheist
Is that true?

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Yeah that shit is true

[Devil:]
Well let me ask you something
Why the fuck you gotta become so difficult?

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
No, see what I'm saying is I can't be simple no more
They don't like that from Brotha Lynch, I always gotta flip shit

[Devil:]
Oh is that right?

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Yeah, and I'm coming out however the fuck I want to come out, you know what I'm saying?

[Devil:]
What about your homies?

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
What you mean "What about my homies?"?
I ain't got no homies, I got my own back fade

[Devil:]
Yeah well I heard a lot of punk-ass shit about your ass

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Yeah niggas always gon' say some punk ass shit about Lynch

[Devil:]
Yeah well me, I think you should go and handle that shit

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Oh yeah yeah, that's finna be handled when the album drop
Personally me, I think you ain't gon' never hear nothing harder come out, but that's just me

[Devil:]
Oh, so is that it?
You think you the hardest motherfucker out or what?

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Nah, nah, see the thing is, you got niggas like C-Bo with that gangster shit
Triple 6 with that devil shit and X with that crazy shit and me the cannibalism shit, you know?

[Devil:]
Oh is that right?
So you a cannibal huh?
I think I can relate to you
Since you don't believe in the Devil, I think you can call me Manson

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Yeah that's cool tho

[Devil:]
Me and you got something in common

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
Yeah I see what you're saying

[Devil:]

[Brotha Lynch Hung:]
