Uh, now that's real gangsta
Tag teamin' on a trick in a Hotel Six
40 on the back, Sicx over top
Diggin' in a spleen with a gangsta lean

It was a dark blue night, I was tore down sleep
Had a 40 ounce of E and a half ounce for me
Just got through rockin' gangsta hits
My brotha Sicx messed around and took the homie's trick
Brought her in the cut and got her all tore up
In the hall, threw up, 'bout to hook her all up
Butts get dug like a grave when I'm high
Shootin' out the barrel of a 7 inch by 5
With a nut all in your dome, split full of that home grown, grown
'Bout to put 'em up on with the bone
Then I'm out, ready to take the back route to the freeway
Grab another oh and a 4-0 on the way
And I'ma know that's the way fools do it in the Loc Blocc
Makin' those cuts, five thousand every show pops
And you gotta know that it just don't stop
Mr. Redrum, Redrum on the cock and my brotha say

Uh, now that's real gangsta
Tag teamin' on a trick in a Hotel Six
40 on the back, Sicx over top
Diggin' in a spleen with a gangsta lean
And uh, now that's real gangsta
Tag teamin' on a trick in a Hotel Six
40 on the back, Mr. Doc in the bathroom
Diggin' in a spleen with a gangsta lean

Now it was all that night that we hooked it up
Had those, 4-0's and 9's in the cut
Just case, fools want funk we got the Right Guard spray
Straight Uzi with them triggers every day
And it's the Baby, the Baby, dead asleep
Tore down drunk, must have been drinkin' Ol' E
While Mr. D-O-C displayin' his G
With a oh in the B-A-T-H-E
My homie Art be breakin' all those
Takin' all those to the room
Drop the crop and let the trigger go boom
And me? Man, I'm just a G
Kick back with a 4-0 and let 'em come to me
One for each and every single homie on the third floor
Smoke a half of O and forget what you heard, yo
What you gotta know is ya just don't stop
Mr. Redrum, Redrum on the cock and my homie say

Uh, now that's real gangsta
Tag teamin' on a trick in a Hotel Six
40 on the back, Mr. Doc in the bathroom
Diggin' in a spleen with a gangsta lean
My brotha, uh, now that's real gangsta
Tag teamin' on a trick in a Hotel Six
40 on the back, Lynch over top
Diggin' in a spleen with a gangsta lean, my nigga
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
To my homies that know, it's all about 4-0's and hiznoes
Ya knizow?
And I'm out
