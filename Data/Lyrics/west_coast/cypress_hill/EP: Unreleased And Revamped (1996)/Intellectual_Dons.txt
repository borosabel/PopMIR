Brand new one from the Call O Da Wild
Give big shouts to money making Manhattan
145th street crews, 155th street crews
All my niggas on the East Side
We gonna flip the track baby, flip the script like this
Big shouts to all the weed spots and all that who know how we do

Moon-Finger Willie slap hard, Monie' chicks
Spillin' Bacardi on club seats
Harm's from the DK-crease-NY fully featured
Harlem incriminate
You dualistic heathens of the street all malfunction seats
Crews stand like mannequins sporting damaged Timb's
Army Cam' and flat burn in self-discipline
And supporting the medicine
Few convinced they fit descriptions of movie-men
Experience and heart with cinematographers having captured raw footage of this
Mischievous black kids dipped in black hooches
Ruthless shotgun car swindler stupid used to pump Luther in ya cougar
Now let the card hold the futures

[B-Real:]
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual trauma causing dime

[Barron Ricks:]
B Ricks stands anonymous to Cagney flicks
And dime bags that can't bonely manifest the Buddha blessed
Impressibly dressed, permanent quest for success
I'm not dressed in materialistic games to get the sex
The five six I'm living fortune of survival tactics
Keeping my enemies close and all my niggas at a distance
What is this?
Slicey characters spreading my business
Fragments that can't manage that do damage yo I had it
Environmental pressure causing static
In fabric of the asiac cabbage it's madness
All this I'm civilized now what do I now?
Run these avenues buckwild with crews now who is it?
Making all you critics fiend these lyrics
And be the core
Yes y'all coming through on your premises
This is it

[B-Real:]
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma

Know I'm saying?
Big shouts to my sacred projects connections know I'm saying?
All my brothers on 113th Lexus to-dial know I'm saying?
Big shouts to the LES baby we see you

Put on Stella performances
While niggas place bids at auto auctions
Re-model frames and changing rusty engines and courting
And while you Forman fools wanna shorten my life
My life is like survival organs
It's not important that you're this lyrical dissertation
Tossing lineal [?] break your vinyl
Chronically spotting spiral perhaps spinning out wax
Yo Nas put the black wars on elegant floors
The teachers got operations make em insecure
Gypsy cabs I flag Donnas DC slam that ass take a detour
Affiliates with my predominately black landscape
Hop the squad I watch the sling shot from rotting up your pin spot
Jostling nigga [?] playing possum
I got the X-ray vision
Ain't nothing popping while the tears who interfere
And the fears they disappear

Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin dons causing trauma
Don't want to do it but they wanna
Just the Intellectual ganja puffin DONS

Ah man that's the Call O' Da Wild flavor baby
I can't take it no more I'm outta here baby
But before we get up out I wanna give big shouts
To all the Buddha spots that made this possible
Big shouts to the 99 cents store baby
The discount health foods know I'm saying?
All the brothers on the Lexus ail with that good, goodness
Big shouts to the party bag shop
To all you other food spots on your roster crew with the end shit
Yeah we out baby don't forget to flip this to the other side
Get with that Call O' Da Wild baby, it's like that yeah
