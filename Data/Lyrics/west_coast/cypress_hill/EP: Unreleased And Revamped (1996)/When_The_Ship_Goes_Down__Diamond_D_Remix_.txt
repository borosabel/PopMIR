Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down

Livin' on phat pockets on flat with the gat
Rollin' around nine deuce Cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke ya ass if ya wanna come chat

That's why some pigs an the kids come sweatin'
They follow a hollow point shells hard to swallow
Why wallow when ya come to roll on I put the clip
An dust bring ya ass on

Kickin' dust on ya head as the gat busts
My grip surrounded
I'm about to get rushed I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet [?]

When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)
When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)

When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)
When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(Ya better be ready)

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down

I told the boys get the sawed off Glock
And the rest of the gats as I strapped on the bullet-proof vest, boom
I think I got one to the chest hot damn
I didn't want to kill a man

Shit, I still stand tall with the hill clan y'all
Better stand back niggas 'bout to fall
I'm comin' out blastin' like Yosemite Sam
Get the cheese an the bread for the ham

When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)
When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)

When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(When the ship goes down)
When the ship goes down ya better be ready
(Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down)
(Ya better be ready)

Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down, goin' down
