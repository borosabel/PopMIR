[B-Real:]
Let me introduce my self
I'm the one who rules the set
So don't you forget
Bad for ya health but ya still be tryin' to push buttons
But you ain't nothin', no fronting
I bring the level up a little louder
In the clubs, in' the jeeps and the after hours
Fools on the street wanna feel the funk
Looking for the 'skunk' that's what you want
Ya better, sit back and let the track flow
Like smoke in ya lungs from puffin' on the indo
Rhythms upside your brain, can ya hang, can ya maintain
Can ya feel the funk flowin' in ya veins
Get you fix and a bag of tricks
In the mix I got the sticks and stones and few bricks
I'm gonna hit 'em high
He's gonna hit 'em low
Open up ya mind so that you can feel the flow
On, an' on 'til they're all gone
Fools be runnin' but they won't last long

I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka

People always wanna get what you got, no matter what
Can't take care of themselves in the big hunt
In the quest for the crown
An' the jewels, and the cheese
Motherfucker please
Enemies wanna plot against me with envy in their hearts
But, I rip their sorry ass apart
In a minute, I can take ya to the limit
Temperature risin', nasal high zen

[Sen Dog:]
Comin' back in with the lows, for the foes
Fuckin' up egos, an' anybody who oppose
The number-one skunk freaka, the Cypress Hill cliqua
Blowin' a hole in the speaker
You don't wanna dis the Perro, the Real One, or the Guerro
Slangin' rhythms through the ghetto
Ya best keep ya ass in check
Come on little motherfuckers better show respect
And what's next, the big brown takin' ya down
How ya feel (how ya feel punk)
When your sorry ass can't hang with the Hill

I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka
I'm the freaka

[B-Real:]
Can ya feel the effects of the Chocolate Thai
Nobody even knows how I kick the flow
Slow down, 'cause ya commin' up too fast
Ya might get smacked down 'cause ya got no class
