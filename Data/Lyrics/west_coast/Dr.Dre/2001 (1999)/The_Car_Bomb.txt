Yo, re-re, come on man, let's get the fuck up out of here, man
All right baby, all right speedy, I'm coming, damn
Took a motherfucking hour to get dressed
I told you I was gonna be here over this motherfucker
I wanna be in and out, now, don't fuck around over here
And baby, I'm looking good, all right, I'm looking good
I'm saying, fuck that man, I'm trying to get the fuck up out of here, man
All right, all right, I'm coming damn shit
Yo, yo, yo, hold it, hold it, what's up, this shit?
You know the people right there?
You know those motherfuckers right there?
No nigga, I don't know, you paranoid
What the fuck they're looking at? I'm saying you ain't seen
The motherfuckers riding past looking all at me and shit
Nigga, you tripping, now you tripping, nigga you tripping
Let's go, scary-ass nigga you high or something, let's keep
Man, fuck that man, get in the car, man aw, goddamn

Man, shut the fuck up, let me start my motherfucking shit
Fuck you, nigga, take me-
