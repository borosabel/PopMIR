
I got you mad at me
And it's so sad to plea
For you to come back to me
So
Instead I'm 'a drop this 'E'
And keep being this 'g'
God had going for me
'Cause you
Don't even see
The real me
So fuck all you faggot who believe in hip hop
You'all
Gonna drop like the cop
I'm 'a kill in the parking lot
That shot at me while I was
Robbing that shop
See my middle finger
Well watch it linger
As I flip you the
Bird and know I'm cumming after you
In this stolen luxury sedan with my two
Glocks in each one of my hands

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

I'm 'a state that this is my fate
To hate and rate you as the bait
And make you
Late
With a 'lil' 'g' like me
Can't you see
You'll never be me
And never have a
Life like me
And never be right like me
'Cause you ain't even half way to being a
Motherfucking 'g' like me
Now I'm 'a count to three 'til I blast your brains
Out...one...two...three
I told you I give out no second chance and
If your motherfucking friends wanna starts their chants and have a blue then I
Will kill 'em and make there families watch 'em few
So then they will go on and
Sue
And watch me swearing at you
And screaming "I don't give a fuck it's only
You"
So you better watch out for when Dr. Kevorkian performs an autopsy on you
While you scream I'm still alive and I sit there laughing with my nine wives

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

I got you mad at me
And it's so sad to plea
