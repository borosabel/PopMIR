Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh, in come funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy it's the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh notes come wrong

Dre is chilling, Ruff is chilling
What more can I say? (Let's make a million)
M-E-L-Man, niggas call me Most
I be rocking on the East and the West Coast
Your mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline
With Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins
This shit be on my mind like O'Donnells interceptions
How would I look with Mike's complexion
Eat me, freak me, take your hand and beat me
All I wanna say is I don't really give a fuck
Cause Most he be mega
Copped the PlayStation but still play the Sega
And in the PJs I DJ and blow amps
Bad as Shrimp Scampi with the food stamps
Huh, I'm not a stranger to danger
On the streets I be known as the jaw re-arranger
Heavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule
White boys say it now "Cool, cool, cool!"
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk
In the SP or the MV, see three G
Hoes see me coming in 3-D
I spread Lizzy with ten mates
Hit the skins and I break out like an inmate
Hey yo, that's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shitting on it

(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)

I warm it up like humidity
Mel (Man), okay I'm here till infinity
My shit be outta... space with the Ewoks
This is my planet but I never wear the Reeboks
When we rock to the beat of a cappella
Most reigns supreme, niggas grab your umbrellas
It's time to bounce so where the player, mate?
Jealous MC's still drinking on that Hatorrade
Bitches flirting with the giggles and chuckles
You'll never get the jizzy bare knuckle
'Cause I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it
Hold up! Back to the clinic
Uh, ah, poked your bitch in the eye
Then I step like Omega Psi Phi (awroof!)
I walk the earth like Moses
Any mackadocious, I grew up with roaches
Shows, I turn out
I got dough but still call my hoes on my burnout
But can't phone long distance
I'm a rich nigga still getting public assistance
Rocking shit on a task cam
Got MCs talking 'bout "I love you, man"
But you can't get my last bud
Or my last dove, outta beats we be making
Dre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quaking
That's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shitting on it

(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)

Yes yes y'all, ooh funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh, in come funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
Every three days and the El change [?]
Ooh, Most come funk
