You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryna stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collecting my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listening to your demo in the stretch limo
Is how I ride, cartel style, vaults stacked to the max now
A million dollar style, niggas wonder how
"Dre Day" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with more chips than Frito Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothing flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, cause

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

Young black Rockefeller, hella Swiss and mozzarella
Pockets sweller, getting money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Cause most niggas erase hoes that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, making dough by the caseloads
I'mma keep building, make a killing
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at, you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run 'vettes
I'm living on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
And watch niggas start plotting, bitches start to stare
Cause game is money, and money is game
And broke niggas make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grinding, diamonds shining, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass and bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts, cause

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

Uh, yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
That's right, ha
All these people out talking about who they are, what they got
Heh, it don't even matter
Been there, done that
As long as you true to yourself, gotta be true to yourself
I was always told
If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything, ha ha
Yeah, that's right!
The Aftermath, beating up on your eardrums
Heh, gotta say what's sup to King Tee, and my man Nation owl
They up in here, gotta say what's up to Chris the Glove
G-L-O-V-E, ha ha
Yeah, that's how it goes down, ha ha, yeah, ah
This is how we coming, heh, yeah
This is how we coming y'all - you know what? Huh
