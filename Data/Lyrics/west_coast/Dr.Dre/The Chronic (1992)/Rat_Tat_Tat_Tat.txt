Hey man, don't you realize in order for us to make this thing work, man, we've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers and the prostitutes?
And then start all over again clean
Nigga, is you crazy?
Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committing mass murder
And we ain't asking for shit, nigga, we taking it
So, Dre, blast they ass, nigga!

Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of L.A. wondering where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hanging out, rolling in my six-four
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside, nigga, ya getting fucked up
I done told ya, creep-creep, ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, I'm fucking up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
One, two, three nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my sixty-four and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Ooh-wee, that's that nigga owe you that grip
Yeah, there that fool is (Well, what's up? Break him off proper then)
What's up? What's happening? (Can I get them ends?) What's up?
Nigga, you delinquent, can I get those ends? (I ain't)
Aye, nigga, pay this nigga (He ain't tripping), well, what's up?
Man, I ain't got your money (Go 'head) Well, yo, check this out, nigga
What's up, fool? What's up? What's up? You don't wantâ€”
Yeah, motherfucker
I'll be back, yo, I'll be back! (Oh yeah?) You ain't never coming back, fool

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah, nigga)

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Creeping and peeping and we can get with these
The Chronic, slanging fat kis from my block
And it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go
To the strip, or take a trip balling with the Row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Indo smoke go in ya lungs like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
Taken away like Calgon, Vietnam
California, back and on a mission
Proving a point, in my game, ain't no fucking competition
They wishing but run up on reality
C-P-T, C-A-L my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change
The business by dropping shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I bill, penitentiary steel, when I kill, it goes

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Hell yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Straight up
Now you niggas know where my homie coming from
So quit the chit-chat 'fore you find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
It's nine-deuce, Dr. Drizzay's sitting on tizzop
It don't stop, treating busters like a punk-ass cizzop
Bitch!
