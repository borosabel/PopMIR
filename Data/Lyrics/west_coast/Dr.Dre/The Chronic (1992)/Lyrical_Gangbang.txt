
This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

Now I'ma kick up dust as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stocking
I'm knocking 'em out the box and
Knocking 'em out their socks and 'cause Robin is rocking
Breaking 'em down to the slab
Taking 'em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfucking paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not the same old plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothing more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is coming through

Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya, spitting out buckshots

I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like the polar cap
Clenching as the hits misses the roller's back
Pushing packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
I'm living large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murdering millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewing motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck with, so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scoping your girl then watch me tag her
Pulling steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

A to the motherfucking K

Back in the days, niggas, they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas, they pull their strap
'Cause, um, police, them come wicked then them shoot niggas
So niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boot stomping
Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator
R-B to the motherfucking X, flex wicked
Stylee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac with a gat
See, nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Buh-buh-buh, now I'm on death row
Fuck it, niggas going wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime stepping through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're getting smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five Gs
Lyrical gang-bang but it's just a G thang
