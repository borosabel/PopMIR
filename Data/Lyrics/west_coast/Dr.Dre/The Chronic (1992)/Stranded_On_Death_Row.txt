
"Yes, it is I," says me
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we, ha ha
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called

Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murdering niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossing
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slanging them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stacking and macking and packing a ten so
When you're slipping, I slip the clip in, but ain't no set tripping
'Cause it's Death Row, rolling like the mafia
Think about whooping some ass, but what the fuck stopping ya?
Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this lynching of sorts
You're a victim from my drive-by of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm serving a
Lifetime sentence, there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead, bang
Laying lame, put to shame, who's to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman coming
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, taking no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust, there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block H

Ayo, stepping through the fog and creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie, little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigger
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still serving for mine
Peace to my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you're saying, "Fuck the police"
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing, baby
Uh, I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I bet you don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfucking Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfucking Peterman
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Dogg's done

Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen
