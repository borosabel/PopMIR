[Warren G:]
Yeah, if you want it I got it ya need it baby
Yeah, it's Warren G beeyatch

[Jah Skills (Warren G):]
(Jah Skills will just speak)
As I enter the G-Funk Era
(tell me why you tweak)
Well I don't know why however
My mind is throbbing
I went bobbing for snapple
Mixed with E&J so my insides just crackle pop
Snap long time ago ya lost ya flow
Now you realize wack MCs I must chastize (what)
The gun toting bumping indosmokin
Bad-ass English 'cause it's broken
Couldn't turn my styles even if ya had a token
You was hoping that I would quit but (aw shit)
I'm hanging around like nut sacs with a dick
I'm sick, I know that styles abstract up your ass crack
Loving this shit called rap ass burning through your back (Jah Skills Motherfucker)
I'm stopping fools like blood clots
My lyrics ring out to stop parties like there was gun shots
Why oh why oh why well why not
Shouldn't I represent this shit called hip hop and it won't stop

[Warren G:]
Well are you high yet
Can you recollect ya talk shit you get checked
Mr. Smutly I'm not a punk thief
Let me break thee, smoke thee, choke thee and locc thee
Motherfucking M-I-C right now how
Wow how dow wow how dow piggy pow
It's me, the Warren to the G gee G Z
It's me uh can I just please thee
Rock the motherfucking M-I to the C all day all night
'cause I will just fuckin' fight 'til I get mines
My ends, let me roll with my friends
Nigga you can't fuck with this 'cause uh I bends
When I bends my style
You can't see this 'cause I'm wicked and wild
Mr. Smutly just slow ya motherfucking roll
It's me Warren G on the motherfucking gangster stroll
Rocking with the T-W-I-N-Ss
So uh let me just bless this

Have you ever heard of a nigga called Warren G

[Trip Locc:]
There ain't no puzzle
I letqs it be known that I'm the trip
Locc packing mo stacking mo shit than I did before
The real niggas from the Eastside, dark side
Breaking off fools in my way on this whoo-ride
So best believe that I'm a threat
(fuck a chin check)
I'm a shoot him while my nigga blaze up the Buddha
And when we light it up, it's on
A taste of the Chronic, another nigga gone, but getting his head flown
(so what you really wanna do) I'd a done it
'cause yo mouth like ziploc so I know you won't run it
Top notch Glock cock so you remember
The flow that I kick is nothing less than a life ender
So watch yo step before you step into my path
Trying to take what's mine is some shit I just roll past

[Wayniac:]
Let me tell you how it goes
Prime example of a night stalker
Caught up in that bind
Using time with my hood as that street walker
(gang bang) so I'm gonna have to take what's mine
Notorious bitches but I don't love no one time
So peep it as I take ya down the backstreet
Show you how I do it (how ya do it)
I breaks em off to get my ends meet (pow)
Victim of the ghetto so I'm slugging
The man won't give me mine so the whitey I'll keep muggins
I'm trapped up in a cycle but I'm keeping my humanity
'cause I ain't going out (us niggas always keep activity)
Niggas say I'm crazy but to others I'm just nutty
'cause I don't give a damn, ya life ain't shit without no money
That's why niggas keep doing niggas but I'm not that nigga to be done
Ya fucking around and set it off Long Beach is where I'm from

[G Child:]
Whoo! Spacekateers, in case y'all didn't know
That was Warren G, that was Jah Skills, and that was the Twinz
Hahaha
This is the G-Child, spacekateer space cadets
It's on like that and it's on like this, so don't miss
