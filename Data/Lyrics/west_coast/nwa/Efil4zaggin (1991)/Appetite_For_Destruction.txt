
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
'Cause her son caught the slug

Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man
Before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga that run is the first to get shot

Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack in fact
And take that shit back
'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that

There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've fuck with it

Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked-up
And the niggas is killin' it's straight fucked-up

Whoever sayin' what I'm saying's for greed
Then I ain't even what they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction

"You guys know who I'm talkin' to."

The appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Try for some violence because they ask me to end this
Some trouble that I caught 'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze

He took a swing for my head
Thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door
But the fucker never made it

The sound of the 9 went bang
And all over the wall was his motherfuckin' brain
'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb

I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga
That don't know me don't understand
I'm from the streets so therefore
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas
The niggas the niggas yo
And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so
But any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve

And it's ready to go to war
'Cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more

And that's a million and one
They couldn't hang with the appetite
'Cause they wasn't rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up the essence appetite for destruction

"Cops put a hurting on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you. 'Oh come on, those beatings, those people resistin' arrest.'"

Check it out yo, in the house yo
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin'
I possess the 10 commandments of the hip-hop thugster,
Known as the thief and murderer:

First one
Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your motherfuckin' neck

Second one
Allways gotta fuck outta wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop

Number three
I'm a gangster, fanatic
I smoke any fool tryna cause some static

Number four
Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore

Fifth one
My killing's just begun
I pull out my gun now they keep me on the run

Step six
Hmmm, it's kinda tricky
Can't forget that I'm motherfuckin' chicken-shit

To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you get to seven you'll be 6 feet deep

Number eight
Make no mistake,
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey

Ninth one
I gotta be raw,
Fuck any brain-washing man-made law

Last but not least, I must be real
Number ten is my appetite to kill

We're interrupting the motherfucking programme to bring you special public service announcement. So listen up while we're taking to our nigga on the street.
