Guilty... before His Son
Guilty, before the whole human race
It's the Lord who expels you... He who is coming to
Judge you..."

It is the Lord who is coming to judge both the living, and the dead
God himself who commends you

[B-Real:]
1 for trouble, 8 for the road
7 to get ready when I'm lettin' off all my load
Funk, Buddha monk, in the trunk
I got you thumpin' so hard
Up and down the blvd
I'm a natural-born cap-peeler, strapped iller
I'm the west coast settin' it on, no one's realer
Get you fix of the uncut funk
A small dose of the skunk weed, like it's suppose to be
Move it up, just move it on out
What you talking 'bout son
I got the first shot, and it's all over now
One nation under a groove
Smoke a pound for the strict of it
Every time I make a move
Smooth and together
Raw like leather
Ain't goin' out like a punk, never

Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove

It's the number one money maker
Money taker, few steps back I'm on a plane to Jamaica, (Am I)
Puffin' a fat wada, talk shit
For the fool I'm thinkin' about, I got the ruff shit
Hard rock bone breaker
Stoned Raider, in the Temple of Boom
Assurt to assume
Never be lettin' shit slide, no way
Bitch niggas can hide
But, I'll find their ass some day

Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove

Wherever you are, put your motherfuckin' spliff in the air
Sound off, like you gotta pair
When I kick to the metro
Lone clip, be lookin' around
'Cause this shit ain't over with yet
People can't understand my situation
Now they caught up in the Soul Assassination
Fool, just take cover, it's all over
When I break ya off a chunk of this motherfucker

Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove
Check it out, 1, 2, Cypress groove
