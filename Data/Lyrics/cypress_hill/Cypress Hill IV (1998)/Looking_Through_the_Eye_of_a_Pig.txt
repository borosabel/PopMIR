[B-Real:]
I wake up every morning, kiss my wife goodbye
Hug my kids, tell 'em I love 'em, I'm out, hit the ride
I'm out on patrol, in my squad car, do I lay
Where you never know, if you'll be making it home today
So many different attitudes, that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, feeling nobody's loss
Hookers hustlers killers and thieves, out on the streets
Got my mind warped, just found another corpse on the beat
Bound gagged raped, I'm frustrated, I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster, body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head, no lie
Sometimes I gotta take a sniff so I can get by, why
Don't I get hurt, 'cause there go my nerves, I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain, relieve my pain
What a fuckin' shame, I don't wanna live, or paint the wall
With the bloodstains, eye of the pig, I see it all

The eye of the pig

I've been on the force, over twenty years, I can say
That I'm worse, than some of these motherfuckers I put away
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law
Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all
Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gang-banging
Pieces of shit who should be on the fucking noose hanging
These days you can't tell who's-who in the world
Is that a whore, or is that, an innocent young girl?
Fuck, I need a drink, and I'm almost off
At the precinct, it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong
I.A. got an eye, on my close friend guy
For taking a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me, we never rat on each other
We went through the academy, just like frat brothers
Midnight, I only have an hour left on my shift
Think i'll get my dick sucked by this basshead bitch
My marriage is all fucked, my wife is with the neighbors
Subpoenaed, now I gotta sign these fucking divorce papers
I recall, happier times, before the fall
Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all

Now I'm on my way, back to the station to check out
So I can go home, relax, take a drink and think about
My abrupt change, out of the clean, to the corrupt
Looking through the eye of the pig, I'm all fucked
No longer can I determine, who's the criminal
From the innocent man down, to the pedophile
No one gives a fuck about me, I'm slipping
Into darkness, I'm coming to grips and feeling heartless
What's this? A dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified, probably a dope dealer inside
"Pull it over to the curb, take your keys out of the ignition..."
And raise your hands out the window and get em in high position
Don't move, or I'm gonna blast your fucking head off
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off
Don't give me that bullshit, I've heard about your raps
All you talking about is slangin' and shooting off the scraps
OK, Mr. B Real, get the fuck out of the truck
I love it how all you fucking rappers think it's so funny
Hit the fucking floor, I need no probable cause
You got a big sack of coke in your truck (what?) so take a pause
You find it funny? Get that smile off your face
Motherfucker take this
