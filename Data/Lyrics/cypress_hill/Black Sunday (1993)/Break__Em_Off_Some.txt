Yeah, eat a bowl of dick'up putos!
Do you wanna get crazy?
Comin' at you in '93!)

Through the crosswinds, the firing pins
Go click when I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out of ammo no doubt
My gat is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home, hit the gate and get my chrome
Hot damn it's on
They got me cornered lemme just warn you
I'll pull this trigger make your family mourn you
Boo-hoo! Where you gonna run to
When I pull out the scooby doo
Run! Let me break you off some
Hit the floor 'cause it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin', punk I'll break you off somethin'!

(1 2 3 that coppa goes down!)

What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a Mack truck that's stolen
Guess what I'm holdin'?
Ammo to bust my load
Still I'm easin' on down
The yellow brick road
Whattaya know? A pig in a plain brown
Wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, lemme just warn you
I'll bring you ass down make your family mourn you
21 gun salute, trying to take my loot
Don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump
And punk, let me break you off something

(Break em' off some)

I got to roll with the self-control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up, I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail, what they get
Is the hollow point shell
Caught in the cell
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice
In the hood but the nigga is senseless
Out on parole, now the nigga has
Turned to my fold, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, wouldn't repay me
Let the punk know that you still can't fade me
Maybe the frontin' would stop, but nothin'
Would stop me from havin' to break'em off something

(On to the next spot kid
We ain't having it y'all
You know what I'm talking 'bout
I'm about to break your ass off something!
Coming from a whammo)
