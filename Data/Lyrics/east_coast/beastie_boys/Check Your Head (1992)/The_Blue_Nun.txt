
Our evening began
In Peter Sichel's comfortable study
In his New York townhouse
Where the candlelight was just right
The Hi-Fi was in the background
And the wine, was delicious

What's the secret, Peter?
Naturally, I'll say it's the wine
Mm mm, it does go well with the chicken!

Delicious again, Peter
