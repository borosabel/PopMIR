
Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to the Hamptons
20 million a wop, ransacking mansions
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, shots gon' stand you up
Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understanding much
I hustle for the duckets
Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
I just love it
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love y'all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and that's right we coming for the title
Do you believe? It's Hova the God
