Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Ducking the plain cops, pushing endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubbling raw
Skully tilted, pants sagging, damn near touching the floor
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feeling like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt
Get your CDs out, let's go, song for song
I'm the illest nigga doing it 'til y'all prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the God, uh, uh, uh
