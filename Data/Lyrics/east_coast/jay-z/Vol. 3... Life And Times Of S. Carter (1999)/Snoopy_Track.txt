Uh, ha, uh, ha
Uh, uh-huh-uh-uh, uh, uh-huh
This for my hustlers uh-huh
And for the bitches yeah

Yo, yo
This is for my niggas down in Houston on candy paint
All my niggas in the Dirty South, Miami mayne
All my niggas in the A-T-L throwing them bows
All them thugs that send slugs through your clothes; holler at me!
It's for the black culture, Spanish chicks with the sweet chocha
Spanish cats with the keys of coca
All the haters eat a dick, they wanna see you broker
I hope the heat stroke ya, the misery is over
All my deep smokers, I hope the leaf choke ya
Hope you'll never be sober, I'ma toast to myself
I hope the Cris' get me, spiraling into a tizzy
So pissy, swerving on the road dizzy
May God protect my soul, angels walk with me
First do the flow sickly, niggas is so shifty
The fo'-fo' is like a force field, you won't get me
I brought some folk with me, Brooklyn is loc'n with me
What the fuck?

You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life
You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life

This is for my chicks that get dough for taking off their clothes
All them money making honies that slide down the poles
All my educated chicks who grade is 4.0
All the baby mamas across the globe; ayo
I like my women friends feminine
I like my hoes on "X" like Eminem, shit!
I like em bow-legged, never coke-headed
With a dough fetish, the drive to go get it
I like their toes proper, I like their clothes Prada
I like their shoes Gucci, I like new coochie
I fucked a few groupies, in a few hoopties
I got 'em Iceberg shit they thought I knew Snoopy
I cop them Rocawear, my mami's dedicated
They never tell me no, the most they said is "not here"
I got their ears studded, both wrists baguetted
I got a main chick, a mistress, and a young bitch
Forget it, I'm the don

You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life
You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life

Wha-what?
This is for my dice shooters, cats doing life
By the time I get this kite to ya, I hope you doing alright
Who got 'em platinum up? Who got the chicks in the truck?
Too much to sit comfortably, they're lapping up
Who shit is big pimping? See the flow different
I drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip 'em
I keep rappers talking to kids, Jigga Sixth Sense'd 'em
Don't mention my name and lames in the same sentence
You see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough
Be so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel
Keep the flow Hova; icy neck, cold shoulder
Who click is closest to La Costra Nostra?
It's The Roc

You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life
You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life
You know, we ride
All day, all night
Pop Cris', shoot dice
Fuck hoes, for life
