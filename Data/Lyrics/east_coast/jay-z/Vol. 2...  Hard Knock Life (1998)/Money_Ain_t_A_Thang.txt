
So So Def

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thing"
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thing
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam-gleam (Yeah, ugh)
And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thing (Ugh, ugh)
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing (Uh-huh)
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thing (C'mon)

Y'all wanna floss with us (C'mon)
'Cause all across the board, we burn it up (Yeah)
Drop a little paper, baby, toss it up (Ugh, yeah)
Slacking on your pimping (Ugh), turn it up
See, the money ain't a thing

I... flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' ho
Jigga's style is love, X and O (Ugh)
Save all your accolades, just the dough (Ugh, right)
My game is wide, all lames aside
Trying to stay alive, hundred thou for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain your eye (Bling)
Twin platinum gun, son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders (Ugh), your money's too young
See me when it gets older, your bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh'd up
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up (Ugh)
Multi 'til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces (Yeah)
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Where you at, haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "Money ain't a thing"

And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thing (Ugh, ugh)
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thing

Y'all wanna floss with us (Yeah)
'Cause all across the board, we burn it up (Ha)
Drop a little paper, baby, toss it up
Slacking on your pimping, turn it up (Yeah)
See, the money ain't a thing

My cake thick, I live the life
Eating crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves (Moves), do the big things (Things)
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit, man (Yeah)
Type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know
If she look, she go bye-bye with da-da
And I ain't gotta say no more
I'm The Truth like A.I. (Yeah), got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buyâ€”know why?
'Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing (Uh-huh)
I don't know about y'all, but every night, I swing (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Y'all, shit ain't for real 'til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill (What)
Said she loved my necklace (Yeah), started relaxing
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction (Whoa)
Went from wholesome to "Jigga, you awesome" (Ugh)
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey (Hahaha)
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice, yeah, yeah, let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Rollie with the ice bezel?
It's gon' take a lot more to see my level (Uh-huh)
Where I'm at your check, you better double that (Double that)
And personally, your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain (Ugh)
In the platinum frame (Screaming) "It's not a game!"
(Gleaming) From ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain (Even)
Me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy
