
Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Bitch!

Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said, "The world don't stop, I got to keep keep on."
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, 'cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said, "I'm never going back"
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?"
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitching
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And recycling it through the ghettos
And building back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitching on each other
I got partners doing 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doing shit
If you didn't snitch, bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it going on
We got the money
Ain't got nothing to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizing

You rat bastard!
