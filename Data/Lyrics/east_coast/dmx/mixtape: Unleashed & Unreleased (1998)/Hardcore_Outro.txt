This that motherfuckin', that real
[KRS-One sample]
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

This goin' out to the hardcore hiphop
Like my man said, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'll let you know who I fuck wit'
Who I roll wit'

Niggas I fuck wit' is the illest, baby gorillas
And shit we do today is gon' catch up with us and kill us
Long as I feel this, motherfucker's head with shots
Fucking lead gets hot, and leave them dead to rot
Top Dawg cuttin' shit up, like raw keys
Like I'm from Crystal Lake and my last name is Voorhies
Could have a niggas door keys and still gun it down
Only cause I know how you look up to a nigga, from the ground
Run it clown, you know better, than to breathe too hard
Word to my kids I'll leave you God
And if you don't know, ask a nigga, that they just put in the ground
Slugs make way by the ounce, so I must've put in a pound
At least! Gave it to another nigga for lookin
Money was dead before the slugs stopped cookin
Remember me, cause I'ma be there when they bury, you
And we'll just get it on in the cemetery

Haha, word up
