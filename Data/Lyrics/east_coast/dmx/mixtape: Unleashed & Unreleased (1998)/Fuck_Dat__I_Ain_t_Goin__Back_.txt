Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

Before I go I make sure I know it's set
I know what I'mma do, I know what I'mma get
I've been planning this shit my whole bid now
They say "Damn he back in jail? What the fuck he done did now?"
Nothing, but that's all right because I'll be home soon
Matter fact, I should reach the port authority by noon
Tomorrow, and you said they'd never let me go
I told you that I'm coming so act like you know
Mom dukes told me, and I knew it was true
"They got places for little bad motherfuckers like you"
In a way I'm reminded of the very first day
Since the fucked up system, made me pay
For something they didn't catch me doing and I remember then
I swore I'd never go back to jail again
Brothers tell me I'll be back but I know there's no doubt
Because this time (what you doing?), I'm going all out

Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

Back on the block, it's the same as when I left
I wonder if my mother still lives in 9F
Banging on the door "Ma, I'm home from prison"
Somebody from inside said "We ain't got no more "lism
Comeback a little later, right now it's too hot"
Damn my mother's crib, done turned into a spot
Only one place left for me to go
I went to see my man Joe with the 5.0
Now Joe is kinda cool and sometimes he does favors
For those that he knows and Joe was a savior
He hit me off with something to eat and a Mac-10
A place to sleep, I said "Yo, I'll be back when
I catch up with the kid that snitched on me"
(Yo D what he did?), go out like a motherfuckin' bitch on me
I want revenge and Joe got the picture
He picked up the 9 and said "Uh, I'm coming witcha"
Came off to his place, knocked, he opened the door
I let off in his face, he fell to the floor
Hit him again, cause I wanted to see more blood
Betcha won't tell nothing else to the judge

Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back

Ain't hard to tell know what I'm sayin?
I'm doing what I gots to do (word up)
To get out the penile, whatever happens just gots to happen
Represent for them niggas

Hit the front of the building
Cops, damn somebody got the call
Must've been the man from down the hall
Huh, let's take a hostage, they can come and get us
If we gotta go, a few cops is going with us
Back upstairs down the hall (What you did?)
Kicked opened the door of the man that called (Then what?)
Grabbed his wife, bitch wouldn't stop crying
I told her that she'd be all right (but what), but I was lying
The boys in blue rolled through in a crew
So I started firing, Joe was busting off too
Next thing I remember is the cops still gunning him
The man and his wife too, I had to flat run in them
And even though I ended up cold dead
My word was bond and I was true to what I said
I always knew that I was going to hell
I just refused to go back to a jail cell

Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
Fuck that, I ain't going back
A nigga like me ain't never going back
