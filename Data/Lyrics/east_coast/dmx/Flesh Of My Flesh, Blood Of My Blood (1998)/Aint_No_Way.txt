[DMX and Swizz Beats:]
Uh
Swizz Beats (Uh, uh)
Nigga, Ride or Die (Uh, uh, uh)
DMX, what, what? (Uh, uh, uh)

[DMX:]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go, oh no! Oh no!
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why

[DMX:]
What the fuck is you niggas pressin' me for? (Uh)
I saw more ass than a ho and you stressin' the raw
If I was testin' your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cause you dont even know me
Nigga check me (Come on!)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin (Uh)
Bad decisions lead to last decisions (What?)
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin' (What?)
Take it over there, now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth? (Arf!)
Let me break it down for you, he's about to attack you (Arf!)
Still standin' here, faggot? You must want me to smack you! (Arf, arf!)
You ain't been there or done that, (What?) fuck is y'all niggas tellin' me?
I'm the only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies (Come on!)
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin'
So leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin'

[DMX:]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go, oh no! Oh no!
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why

[DMX:]
Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me
Hit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC
Been a lot of places most niggas won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be
Let your man hold somethin now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggas want, raw
Niggas laugh at me and was mad at me
Cuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy (Come on!)
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it (Come on!)
So if I see it, I'ma dot it, (What?) where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it (Come on!)

[DMX:]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go, oh no! Oh no!
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why

[DMX:]
Niggas don't know, so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in your mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in your chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow (Come on!)
I'ma go platinum (Nah) you gots to be kiddin', why?
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin' (Come on!)
And I'ma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows
Strippin' hoes, gettin' dough, let me go! (What?)
And niggas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is, the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this, 'cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a nigga's necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast (Come on!)

[DMX:]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go, oh no! Oh no!
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why
