[Posdnuos & Trugoy the Dove:]
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

[Posdnuos:]
Tell me what's more essential
Rap lines, party past nine
Or reading which is fundamental
Tell me what's more pollution
Black fog, burning logs
Or infested prostitution
Tell me what's more appealing
Fast food job, corn on the cob
Or interstate drug dealing
Tell me what's more tantalizing
Flip flops, skeezer lies and props
Or 3-Feet High and Rising
Tell me, what's more?

[Trugoy the Dove:]
Tell me what's more demanding
A dominant race, a fad called base
Or peace and understanding
Tell me what's more neglected
Teaching our seeds the fact there's greed
Or words being said in a record
Tell me what's more pathetic
A lollygag lush, the habit to cuss
Or a lawsuit filed on a medic
Tell me what's more amusing
Comic strip, or break that hip
Or what Prince Paul's producing
Tell me, what's more?

[Posdnuos (Trugoy the Dove):]
Tell me what's more old-fashioned
Lemonade, a black man's fade
Or a kiss that's soaked in passion
(Tell me what's more secretive)
(Love looks, a diary book)
(Or the De La style us speakers give)
Tell me what's more off-tempo
Wearing pink, a fizzy Lipton drink
Or a brother with acne and dimples
(Tell me what's more confusing)
(A Rubik's Cube, a dusted dude)
(Or a figure in which one is choosing)
(Tell me, what's more?)

[Maseo:]
Yo, Pos and Dove, stand clear to be plugged up
Ah, the hell with that, I ain't got no time to be playin' with it
Just tell me what's going on, I just wanna know what's going on
Go ahead, Pos and Dove, tell me what's going on, man
I just wanna know what's happening, man
Ah, you don't wanna tell me what's going on
I'd just like to say what's up to the Jungle Brothers
I'd like to say what's up to the Quest
I'd like to say what's up to Monie
I'd like to say what's up to Latifah
Mike, you in the house
Hey, Pos, Dove, what's going on, baby?
Prince Paul, hey, what's up, man? I'm coolin'
This is P.A. Mase and I just wanna say
Hey, Kool DJ Red Alert, what's up, man?
Ah man, we outta here, alright, peace, y'all
