
Y'all got three minutes do what y'all wanna do
Yo, so speak as free as possible

Check the clock!
Watch me!
Come on!
Funky!

Bright everyday I wake up
Look at my travels they scuffed up
Ring go the telly which I pick up
Turn on the news as it screws up
Mase on the line to see if I'm up
Wrong thing to do at 5, I hang up
Lay on the floor sit and think up
Why the whole world alone is messed up

Woke up the same morning I felt fine
Took me a shower I smelt fine
Checked out the weather it looked fine
Made some breakfast, I cook fine
My girl calls me, she's so fine
Wanted me to help her go find
Some shoes but I had words to define
And it was Tuesday, I had to tape P-Fine

Folks styling jokes get the time set
Blooming of the tune growing it's set
Positive it is and perfectly set
Soul go to show soon we all set
Slipping lunatics shipping one set
Need is for these not upset
Chance to spread word we're the full set
Rhythm weighs more than your weight set
3 will be the number till sunset
Plug 1 & 2 now we all set
Dove praises flow in your headset
Flow De La Flow there is no threat
Categories carry difference in sets
Differences is equal to an offset
De La from the Soul and its kept set
Soul is the reviver, Mase are you set?

Watch me!
Put it there!
You got to get it!
Get it!
Shout now!

My name's Posdnuos and I'm above sink
The world is so out of synch
A lot of emcees can't play sync
That's why unfortunately they sink
But problem and speak are no way sync
We wash problems like hands in a sink
I hate to make this rhyme leave sync
But the reason De La bad is cuz we think

It took us a time but the crew's here
Activate a dance when you hear
A roll from the Soul like this here
And respond to the bond that assists here
Politics of speaking are intended here
And the president of paragraph will end it here
Cuz the three has completely lured here
That freedom of speak is assured here

Folly fit the frequency in your show
Wa...

Yo, you all only had three minutes!
