Access to her code
Love-struck Dove is Dove's mode
Took a look, Drop my books
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Breakfast was our Greetings
Yogurts and bird seeds what I fed
Slipped a note, rocked my yacht
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Jenny, only thought about Jimmy
But didn't think about Derwin
The Jimmy who's only a virgin

Steady we go, Jenifa led
Pluggin' her tune was freedom well said
So what's the fix, oh Jenifa
Can a brother of the soul get swingin'?

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the break, found her shake
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Transcripts showed more than flirt
'I love daisies' read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Morals shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found her house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, 'Kick it!'
Posdnuos was in

Jenny, only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?

She said, 'Let's try it in the bathroom,'
But 'Dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan
And came back wrapped in saran

Positions, Muscle Flex
Dove was lost in Aghonal-hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Notions soothed the mood
Dove was lost in De La heaven
Screwed Plug Two, did the do
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Jenny
Teased my homeboy Granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

Did her thing while I plugged once
Hope she don't fall fat nine months
From now, I'll tell you what
Trugoy ain't ready

Worned out was my cater
Mind you this was three days later
The door tune blew, you guess who
Jenifa, oh Jenny

Advance to the radio
Teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she wrapped me up in a ball of twine

No more, I dispatched
Was it Jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realization
All girls owned a Jenny

For normal health I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you can give plenty
