
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any alter service
Prerogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle their admittance I'm with it
Simply soothe, well moved vinyl like groove
Transistors are never more shown with light
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to the clue of the naughty noise called
Plug tunin'

Doo do, doo do, doo do, doo do, mm hmm mm yeah

Flowing in file with a new style
Barrels are cleaned then loaded for salute
Chanters with the choice standing steady like my mouthpiece
Paragraph preacher is now introduced
Drums are heard sounding off in each and every person
Vocal confetti is thrown at top stage
Roses and violets aren't proper for throwin'
For showin' appreciation, why?
This is a Daisy Age
Hands won't sweat 'cause there's no threat
Mic will stay dry while place at soul use
Rhymes aren't fables but stable to be on time
'Cause they're marketed and labeled speaker Posdnuos
The Stitch will fit with every consumer
Microphone use in sales will start Bloomin'
Profit and cost could never be lost
All due to the clue of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Doo do, doo do, doo do, doo do, mm hmm mm yeah

Dazed at the sight of a method
Dive beneath the depth of a never-ending verse
Gasping and swallowing every last letter
Vocalized liquid holds the quench of your thirst
Reasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown
Different individuals are dazzled with the showbiz
Auditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather
Hold a count at four and in the end leave it as it is
Flow to the sway of my do-re-mi
I'll fix lunatics who will hawk
Words are sent to the vents of humans
Then converted to a phrase called talk
Musical notes will send a new motto
Every last poem is recited at noon
Focus is set, let your Polaroids click
As they capture the essence of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Doo do, doo do, doo do, doo do, mm hmm mm yeah

Vocal in doubt is an uplift
And real is the answer that I answer with
Dying yet live, what you must realize
That the tune that I present is surely not a gift
Different in style is definite
And style which I flaunt is sure legit
Now set aside, I say I hold pride
In performing this melodic misfit
So swing 'cause this pitcher is pitching
In sense, JD Dove is now saying
All sing along to his favorite song
While the pocket transistors are playing
Least but not last, I'm frightened
For the worlds that I reply hold doom
Life of the chant can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping the wire of the plug tune

Doo do, doo do, doo do, doo do, mm hmm mm yeah
No one that I know can live my life for me
