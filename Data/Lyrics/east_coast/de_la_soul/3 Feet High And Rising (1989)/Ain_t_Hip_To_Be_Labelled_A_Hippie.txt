In America today (In America today)
People think they know the way (Think they know the way)
Of the Soul, De La is on the road
To blink and clear the hay (Clear the hay)
Behind the line of inner fine (Inner fine)
We've explained this time and time (Time and time)
Daisies don't mean everything (Everything)
Daisies don't mean anything (Anything)
But the word itself when broken up
Wears just a larger pound (A larger pound)
D.A. stands for "T-H-E" (T-H-E)
I is "Inner" (Inner), S is "Sound" (Sound)
Y is "Y'all", that's you should see the Inner Sound
Shall help you breathe
But still I sport a heavy sigh (A heavy sigh)
When I have to explain

[Posdnuos:]
It's just me, myself and I
It's just me, myself and I
It's just me, myself and I
It's just me, myself and I

[Prince Paul & (Posdonus):]
So, you're just yourself, huh, Pos?
(Basically Paul, that's it)
You mean you're not a hippie?
(No)
Not even a half a hippie?
(Not a nugget)
Wait. What about you and Dove's parents?
(Straight up Soul brothers and sisters)
So what the full equation shows is "The Inner Sound Y'all"
Should be focused on, not just the word 'DAISY' itself
(Most definitely)
Wait a minute. Did you say "Most definitely"?
(Rrrr-rah!)
