You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate

[Trugoy the Dove:]
Ayo, let's skin the ghost
Because the sheet's been stained with the ocean
(Wishy-washy, wishy-washy, wishy-washy)
I am the elf to the seventh closed closet
Burnt to the Flintstone
Singin' in the Black man's wish
Figure me zoomed to the outskirts
Slave with the big black sword down in the underbelly
Walk, run, pluck
Abstinence to fucking
The M equals unknown
Timbs made foot to skills
Tally on, tally on
Tally on, I'm not hard

You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate

[Posdnuos:]
Oh yeah, where we, where we be, where we go?
(Yo, I got that fat shit)
To make matters worse
(Yo, I got that fat shit)
You got the money in the purse
(Yo, I got that fat shit)
Had to sit down for a while
For my style was too heavy to bear
(Yo, I got that fat shit)
Rub my head to contemplate
(Yo, I got that fat shit)
Went on the blind date
(She was a fat shit)
I'm not home

[Trugoy the Dove:]
I get gooder than gettin' be (Good)
Gooder than, gooder than, gooder than
Gettin' be (Good)
Time to play the low self watch
I get to zone on the kosher stuff
With my avenue attitude
But I'd really a like psycho meditation (Anybody, anybody)
Amazing (Anybody, anybody)
With my Indonesian boogaloo
Makes the mix 'cause the rainy weather is flyin' soon
And ABC News won't be able to catch it, baby
I'm not home

You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate
You can't beat my mindstate

[Posdnuos:]
When a sperm cell met with Hattie
(Twelve months later)
My first words was "dad"
Then I ran into a Peppermint Patty
Charlie Brown gets mad
(He's coming after me)
(No, he ain't)
Yes, he is
(No, he ain't)
He's now over my house shootin' out all the windows
(Broken glass everywhere)
Just like I'm standing here doing the same to his
(Everywhere)
'Cause I'm not home
