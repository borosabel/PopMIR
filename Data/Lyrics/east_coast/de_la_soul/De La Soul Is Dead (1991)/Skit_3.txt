[LAWNGE & Mase & Aub:]
Blaahh! Oh man, this album sucks, man they starting to sound just like MC Shan's. I don't like it, I don't like it
I know, that jam 'Who Do U Worship'? What they on
Some old devilish shit or somethin'? What's up?
'Afro's got a slammin' beat, but what are they saying?
Yo... 'Afro's is... wack!
That's really cool, gee!
I don't like it
(Whap!)
Why don't you stop with him man!
Listen, listen! I'm Hemroid! I'm the leader! Now put the tape back in and give me the tox!
