(Hey)

[Pos and Ann Roberts:]
Hey Love
Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
Cause you're my Hey Love
(Hey)
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
(Hey)

[Tesha Stills and Pos:]
Look Pos, we gotta talk
Talk about what?
Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
What?
About you becoming fully dedicated
So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has anything to do with love
Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't that showing you love?
You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
You wanna be my what?
I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood being one of the many girls on your list, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named Selena from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
Look I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul, I don't have two kids in every state
But you probably got two girls in every state. If you're not
Going to go about it the way I want you to, then just leave, cause I can't be so bothered
Yeah
(I can't be your lover)

(Where's that voice coming from? From... from nowhere?)
