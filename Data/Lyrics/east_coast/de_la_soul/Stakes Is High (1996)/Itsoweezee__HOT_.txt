If money makes a man strange – we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go 'round
If love is against the law – listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's going down

If money makes a man strange – we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go 'round
If love is against the law – listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's going down

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nothing but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sending off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl 'cause we cooking up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me
I'm keeping it clean, like a washing machine
And yo, get your locomotion run into full steam
I'm sending out a greeting to my man Daseem
I got a child so I gots to get the green, right right

If money makes a man strange – we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go 'round
If love is against the law – listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's going down

Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's getting hot

I own the deeds to some acres in the West Indies
Where my pops is building residence to house my seed
Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you niggas like Yahtzee
Cracking jokes like you're Potsie
(When's the last time you had Happy Days?)
Blazing up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singing like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressing rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pulling on my coattail
Like some horses pulling coaches, whoa your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cooking in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

If money makes a man strange – we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go 'round
If love is against the law – listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's going down

If money makes a man strange – we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go 'round
If love is against the law – listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's going down
