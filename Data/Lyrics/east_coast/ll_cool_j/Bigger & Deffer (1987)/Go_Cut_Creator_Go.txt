5, 6, 7 o'clock 8 o'clock rock
9, 10, 11 o'clock 12 o'clock rock
Gonna rock (what?) rock, rock around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens
I was rocking at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot
Didn't know years later I'll be standing on top
Live in Farmers Boulevard I was born in Bayshore
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader, now watch him go

Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go

Way back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin' and prayin' one day I'll get on the road
So I'd have Fila in the summer and a mink when it snowed
Not fearing a thought, cock-strong like a horse
No man's runnin' my posse, 'cause each man is a boss
When he's home, he can't wait to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break

Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go

This jam is wild enough for Jimi Hendrix to sing
If you need lessons of the mix he'll take you under his wing
Straight from the heart 'cause it ain't money that we came here for
Ain't enforcin' no rules, ain't breaking no laws
We ain't a rock'n'roll band, in pinstripe and plaid
Just my posse learned to work with what little we had
It's all about us three: E, Phil & Jay
You heard Cut Creator cut, now check it out we can play

Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go

Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like travellin' through time to the "Stray Cat Strut"
Cuts are slicker than grease, needles sharper than knives
We'll be do doin' the do for the rest of the lines
Wanna piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer puttin' change in a cup
Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin' up and down
Bite your lip and hold your breath until we come to your town

Cut Creator cut the record for me

(Chorus with LL in the background saying "Cut it")
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go

L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S

("Cut it" in background)
Go, go, go, go, ah, go

(Chorus with LL in the background saying "Cut it")
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
Go, Cut Creator, go
