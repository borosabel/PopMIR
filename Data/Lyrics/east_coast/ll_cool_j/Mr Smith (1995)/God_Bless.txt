Definitely gonna be butter, nah mean?
It's gone be butter, nah mean?
Uh, swerve on em, uh yeah
Crack the Mo, here we go
I'm in the mood to let the chicken heads flow
Son, no doubt, God. It's real
Every member of my clique is equipped with steel
Suger, let's (Heesha!), uh, God bless

Just the type of man that can lace the crowd
Which ya hands on ya or you could raise them proud
I bust shots off
Put my hands on my shorty and I make it hotter
I got a lock ya, flavor to bring
Got the championships so I'ma savor the ring
Church boy, raised by my grand mamma
Home-bred, I dead all the drama
I'm like the mystical funk technician
It's a sign of the times, guards on a mission

God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you

Have mercy!
Nowadays I got them other niggas acting thirsty
Bless the sky, energy created by my third child
Swerve with it, get it get it
Feels good to bust shots at the critics
You crave more taste of my funk
When my track drop ain't enough space in ya trunk
Soul for real, but not the group
I'm solo goin' for dolo in the drop Coupe
I distribute melodies while ya gold trees
Step a dip like a flip, '96 kiss

God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
Matter fact take it to the bridge

God bless
God bless ya lover
God bless
God bless ya lover
God bless
God bless ya lover
God bless
God bless ya lover

Honey dippin' off my Nautica sleeves
With them Gortex boots, that compliment all the cheese
Shouldn't hate me 'cause I'm raw
(I thought you fell off kid!) You said that shit before
But you see miracles when you're lyrical
Off some LL shit, chickens get hysterical
'Cause I form like Voltron
Let's get it on and take ya chime bomb 
Knock it off
I like your style but it's a slight bit soft
Son, the LL rule, huh
I pick it up and lay it down mad cool
It'll cost you a fortune (What?)
For me to make it hot, heat it up and keep it scorchin'

God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you
God bless ya lover. God bless you

It's all built for '96 kid!
No diggity, [?] lace me
Nah mean? Lil Chris in the house
Ol Moms, Big E and the fam
Yo son, who's next?
