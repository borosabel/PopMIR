Word up, just wanna bring em to it real
Real rugged like, uh, man
Make me feel like I'm method out and all that, y'nahmean?
Go digging, uh check it

I bring the butter, huh
Make you wanna creep up on one another, huh
I'm mad sharp like a box cutter, huh
I got the fam rolling like brothers, huh
We in the mecca, Moey, Rollie glistening
Raining on niggas so bad they think it's drizzling
Ground zero funk track it's mega
Doing wild damage to your arm, legga legga
Who's that? The bawler, the player, the mister with the techniques
Pumping blends, creeping up the backstreets
Throw your rocks up high and let em gleam
It's the Uncle what? Uncle L makes a wild scene
And I be blowing all the rookies out the frame
And they be knowing Uncle's flowing in the game
Queens to uptown I'm getting down for my crown
When you see me coming through just gimme a pound
And say

Yeah
I'm 'bout to wet it up, get it up
Take a track, drape it in jewels and set it up
I'm so nasty with mines, I warm it up like raw liquor
Dime pieces throw it at me like a free picker
I'm open, I let the funk soak in
I taste like an eighth, ya freeze and start choking
Yeah son I'm all up in ya mix
Ya calling in your clique, I'm bawling with your trick
Golden rocks falling off my neck and wrists
When I breeze by, you be grooving in the midst
Of my cycle, every move I make is vital
Crucial, official. Brothers saying, "L, we miss you."
Much love to all the shooby doobies and cliques
While you're bawling in the coupe you know I had to get the six
Get your swerve on boo, chill with me
Get me, I want the cream, baby hit me

Now take it to the bridge

(Keep it coming baby)
(Keep it coming baby)

(Keep it coming baby)
(Keep it coming baby)
(Keep it coming baby)
(Keep it coming baby) Keep on

Somebody tell me the way I keep coming up
Funk running up and mad spots is blowing up
It gets hot when I manifest melodies
Beating niggas all in their heads, so what you telling me?
Get your drink on, throw you mink on
Let your head nod, stick it out, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I got ya deep deep down inside my mixture
Swerving curbs, serving as I fixed ya
Formulated and combinated, the people congregated
You fronting for nothing, your crew is overrated
And I'm'a take it on down to the AM
Keep the drama flowing 'til the party cave in
Uh, I get you open, baby come and get a fix
Yo, that's word to mother I be dropping mad shit
Let's organise, bounce together for real son
Trick a little though, sip a little Moe, peace one

(Keep it coming baby) Keep it going baby
