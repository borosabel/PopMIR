
Yeah
Smoking, doping, keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have em even saying, "How could someone say that?
They're as good as the man who just saw
Cool J, please give me some more
Of those hooping, scooping, rhymes you be trooping."
If you don't know the new dance, Patty Duke 'n
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatching airplay from all you AIDS-catching singers
It's a special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
'Cause I love to lay down joints for the playground
And have you O.D.-ing, saying, "Y'know? J sound righteous
The brother did what he had to."
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleeping, breathing saying, "Yo, he ain't keeping
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend."
But here it is, the jam of all jams
And from this day forth, MCs are getting slammed
With the

Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah!

I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swinging it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singing it
Doing a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it (Ho!) you'll only get one chance
To work out the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MCs I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturing them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're trying to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me. Tell you what? That brother L ain't trying to flip
With the

Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah!

Moving, grooving, admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool, calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Going so crazy I have the girlies saying, "Wait, James!"
I do damage - use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be saying, "How did you manage
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed."
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealing
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheeling
Or on your Walkman as you're staring at the ceiling
Or when you and your love is sex-appealing
To the

Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah!

It's like a smooth joint, you know what I mean?
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out

Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aw yeah!

Marvelous!
