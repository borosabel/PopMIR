[Verse 1:]
Let me get to the point real quick
When ya pockets are thick
Mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
All the ho's go sweat you like a movie star
To get in ya pockets
That's what the girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only nock boots when you got loot
You on the map
Cause if you broke you'll get a wack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then ya start loosin all ya bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and outta luck
Then she takes off and brakes off
Ya ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings OK
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus:]
If you don't got endz you won't be gettin no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't skoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be gettin no ass
And if you don't got loot you won't be knockin no boots

[Verse 2:]
Girls of the 90's ain't nuthin but crooks
It's all about what's in ya pockets not how ya look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leavin brothers for the next man cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar
And if you pushin a fresh Benz they'll be ya best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect endz
You think shes all yours
But as soon as your dough go your ho go
Now you solo
But when you was makin papers sucker jumped ho's
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was takin em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke the girls not speakin
Cause nowadays girls want you to crook
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
Cause when you on top everythings OK
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
I tell it how it is cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me askin me can they get some money
I'm lookin nuthin like ya poppa
I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz I'm a break it down like this

[Chorus x2]

[Outro:]
It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm livin swell ya'll
I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all
(If you don't got endz)
Girls be frontin
(If you don't got endz)
They ain't givin up nuthin
(If you don't got endz)
All the girls they ignore you
(If you don't got endz)
They act like they never saw you
(If you don't got endz)...
