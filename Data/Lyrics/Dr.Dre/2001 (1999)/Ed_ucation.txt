A black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfucking Earth, is her momma
It's her momma that told her
"Get a man that got a good job girl!
Make sure he got a good car girl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you something girl!"
What happened to just falling in love with a nigga with a bus pass
Just cause you love the nigga?
But I'm the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!

Biggest hoes, on planet Earth
Are walking through the motherfucking neighborhood
You knew when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant – didn't you bitch, didn't you!
The old keep a nigga baby
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
"Aw that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here
Cause that nigga ain't shit."
How bout being a woman, and telling the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a ho!
Tell the kid!
Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here – but he a good nigga
Cause he take care of his real family
I was just a dumb bitch, trying to keep, a nigga that I wanted
