
Yeah, nigga, we're still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doing that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sure
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sure)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wrecking Crew
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Bitch)
Laid-back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangsters all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still running the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representing for them gangsters all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Right back up in your motherfucking ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of things
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha
