Welcome to the aftermath
(Like we always do about this time)

Welcome to the aftermath!

The aftermath, a second growth, the period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from the Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep
You ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?

The aftermath brings to you some of the best hip-hop and R&B on the planet

We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're here!

Watch yourself, peep the blow up
From state-to-state we're touching home no matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slipping
Bringing you all banging speakers for sparks fly out the car system
Off the tops, snatching props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music the different sound view
R&B, rap, whatever flavor kid it's all new
So let's say we bring it with the east and the west!
The final results: the aftermath touching every coast!
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest if they business is tight
'Cause keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly building and stop destroying everything that we touch
And leave something for our children

Whatever it takes to get you paid yeah-yeah-yeah, keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, keep on doing it
And whatever it is that gets you free yeah-yeah-yeah
(Gets you free, yeah) keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, hey keep on doing it
Whatever it takes to get you paid yeah-yeah-yeah
(Whatever it is) keep on doing it
You gotta keep doing it, keep on, keep on yeah
And whatever it is that gets you free yeah-yeah-yeah
(Whatever it is that gets you free, yeah) keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, oh yeah oh-I

You gotta-you gotta keep on doing it, doing it, doing it
Aftermath is gonna keep on doing it, doing it, doing it, yeah

Anybody killer!
