
Ah yeah
Ah, ah
Ah yeah

Time and time again
Through our relationship
I've wondered what's going wrong
To make us go through, such pains and heartache
But still I know
That my love is so strong for you

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

I don't understand
Why you wanna take me through these changes
No no
Oh
I can't decide
What to do when it comes to me and you
Because my love is true
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Where do we go from here?
(Where do we go?)
I can't help but wonder
(I can't help it baby)
Do we belong together?
The love I feel can't be alive

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

All alone
I don't wanna lose your love
On my own
Just can't be without you baby, no
Wanna be
Gotta have you in my life
Can't you see
We can make it if we try

[Repeat until fade:]
Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices
