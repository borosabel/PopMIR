Woo

Dedicated to the Hub City
Straight West Coast nigga, ain't no pity
Put holes in niggas, real pretty
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty
I give drugs to the thugs price-free
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T
No doubt players like me
Recognise the great King Tee, about twenty grand a ki
Ah, that's that G shit, no doubt about that
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap
And get your niggas off my back
And no, God, ya don't pull a strap, 'cause [*gun shot*] fuck that!
I'm very precise when I shoot
Straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe
Ya wanna blame Tha Alkaholik group
But, naw, that nigga Tela must've hit the loot
'Cause he's acting real loonie
And I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie
The hood rats wanna do me
So if you've got your county cheque give it to me

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Huh, so I guess I earned the title 'OG'
Been down for ten years, this my fifth LP
I'mma give this one to Eazy-E
A real motherfucking G, R.I.P
Now all these fools talking 'bout they some killers
Car stealers, big time drug dealers
Bitch ass niggas keep it real, don't lie
You ain't killing shit and they gon' let shit die
You ask "Who the hell am I?"
They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all
And I come throat ya hood like a locc ass G
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC
It's only one way, let's have gun play
I make it play, nigga, fuck what you got to say
I got a mad crew of murderers, ex-burglars
Putting soft niggas outta service

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, all the fucking chips blown
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone
Baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, sitting on chrome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

My whole crew lives illegal
Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal
Smoking that sticky green grass
Hitting switches, bumping on cuts from the past
We smoke leaf 'cause we live like Gs
Super-soft niggas become enemies
I hit a lick on the East for ten kis
Now everything I drive is on Deez
I'mma make you believe, I gotta put it down like a real nigga should
My dope spot in every nigga's hood
I don't waste time, I need to get what's mine
Fourteen shells from behind
Leave you in the blind, str-8 paralysed from ya spine
A partner of organised crime
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth
'Til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

And I'm gone
