While childish MCs battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeed-y, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyota driven
True and living driving with the gat
Uh, pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diesel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic

East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer

Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin their career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nut sack yo I stay focused
Beefing without skills seeking will only weaken
The artist speaking over beats and, you be cheating
Cacophony of small talent rappers, claiming a coast
Over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopping ya correctly
Ignorant ass MCs continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cell block
Too many MCs rapping causing lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voice box
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be using
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
What you think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid!

Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constitutional rights have been suspended

The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast tripping going on through out the business
East-coast west-coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'mma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killing in the high rise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringing the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill

Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!

East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 

Now when I bomb like Saddam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, emerging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatching hoes up, my flow's up
When the fucking world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, fronting like you down for the real
To make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal
Like Henry Hill (kill that noise!) but what's the fucking deal?

East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 

East-coast, west-coast, kill that noise!
