Something about yo' business, I really don't understand
But if you keep on teasing me girl, I'm gon' be your man
Something about yo' business, I really don't understand
But if you keep on teasing me girl, I'm gon' change your plan

[Snoop Dogg:]
You got yo' thang, and I got mine
You see, I can give it to you like all the time
If you, gimme them digits let me holla at you baby
Stop playing games, let's do this damn thang
'Cause you the whole thang, with the candles and the ice
And then the champagne, whoot wham bing bing bang bang!
Now, what's love got to do with this?
'Cause if you cool with this I'm through with this
Baby is we doing this?

I know when you'll change your mind
That's when your rent is due (when your rent is due)
And you're many months behind
How's that to treat your friend
With that attitude, you can leave it all behind

Something about yo' business, I really don't understand
But if you keep on teasing me girl, I'm gon' be your man
Something about yo' business, I really don't understand
But if you keep on teasing me girl, I'm gon' change your plan

[Snoop Dogg:]
You say that you don't, you say that you won't
I think that you will, 'cause girl I'm way too real
And every girl need a G, and we see G
I saw you looking at me, when I was with Warren G
You peeping not speaking and that's freaking me out
It's something 'bout yo bidness baby and it's flipping me out
I really can't understand why it's so easy, for you to tease me
'Fore it's over, you'll be Miss Snoop Deezy
