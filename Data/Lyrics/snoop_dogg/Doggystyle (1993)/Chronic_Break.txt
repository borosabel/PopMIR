
Can we get a motherfucking moment of silence
For this small chronic break?
A-hah, yeah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Takin' bitches out to eat, and spendin' money on these hoes. You know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes;
You'll never go 'Platinum'"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
