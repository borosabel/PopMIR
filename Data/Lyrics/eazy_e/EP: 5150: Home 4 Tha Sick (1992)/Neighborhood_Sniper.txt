[Eazy-E]
First up high on a roof top
Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at it's own pace
Sometimes I feel like a super hero
Urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
Now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
So it's the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyones scared I'm the neighborhood sniper

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head 
And simply scared the bitch boo
Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now there's nothing left but a snitch
Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One [Shot] two [Shot] three strikes your out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window
I made my escape the cops chase 
Duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin' fair of a neighborhood sniper

[Chorus]

[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission
Killin' all fools as an addiction
As a E lovin' the game leavin a shame
And in my heart I feel no muthafuckin' pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And my A.K.47 I stand bold
Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Pop pop pow as I watch the muthafucka drop
Lovin' the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm
And never hyper as I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper

[Chorus]
