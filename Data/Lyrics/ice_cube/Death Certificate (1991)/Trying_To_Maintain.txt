I'm just tryin' to maintain (Maintain)

To everybody tryin' to maintain (Maintain)
And keep they name out the mainframe
Yeah, we all in the same gang
Yeah, we all with the bang-bang
Been a vet, nigga, broke the internet
'Cause they can't fuck with my intellect
Yeah, nigga, all y'all followers
Follow every word like swallowers
Wanna catch it when I spit it
Fuck a critic and his analytics
I don't fit in your formula
I only fit in your bitch, I'm warning ya
Please don't feed the animals
When they got they face covered in pantyhose
Niggas ain't nothin' nice
Take your grandmama chain and your life

'Cause we all tryin' to maintain
'Cause we all tryin' to maintain
I'm just tryin' to maintain (Maintain)
I'm just tryin' to maintain (Maintain)

To everybody tryin' to maintain
With a little Mary Jane on the campaign
Whip by you in the fast lane
Only act like this 'cause of Black pain
Fuck your cancel culture, bitch
You can't cancel a soldier, trick
See, I thought I told ya
Drunk or sober, tell you when it's over
Slap the shit out a troller
I kill shit like Ebola
I'm the sun, I'm the solar
Your baby mind is in a stroller
Too much game for the peabrain
I have no alliance to no Greek names
Some of y'all down with the fucking royals
I'm only down for the fucking soil (That's right)

And I'm just tryin' to maintain
And I'm just tryin' to maintain
Without goin' insane (Crazy)
Without blowin' out your brains

I just wanna maintain
Do what I do, let my nuts hang
The insane never explain
'Cause all we wanna do is them big thangs
Checkmate if you trick-made
Out here lookin' for that clickbait
You need to hustle on that computer
I'm a rooster always thinkin' 'bout the future
And I'ma smoke it like a chimney
Sippin' on Henny, sayin' fuck 2020
Some of y'all ain't worth a penny
I keep it one thousand and keep you dialed in
Pull up, my niggas pile in
Now I'm with the wolfs and we howlin'
Profilin' and we stylin'
Sad motherfuckers, get your violin

If you're just tryin' to maintain
If you're just tryin' to maintain

I'm just tryin' to maintain (Maintain)
Yo, I'm just tryin' to maintain (I'm just tryin' to maintain)
I'm just tryin' to maintain (I'm just tryin' to maintain)
I'm just tryin' to maintain
