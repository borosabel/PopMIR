Them people, they coming
Listen
Wake up
Ayy, you got to get up
Ayy, them folks is at the door, man
Get up
Get up

They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

This ain't paranoia, this is California
Best believe, motherfucker, that they coming for ya
Got the place surrounded, don't know how they found it
Man, fuck that money, ain't no time to count it
Got to get to movin', only God can save us
This is the day they try to re-enslave us
Grow my hair long, Angela Davis
So I can get recognized by the space invaders
Storm troopers, have you heard the latest?
They'll treat your living room like the Oakland Raiders
Take all your books, you ain't patriotic
You psychotic, your neighbors call you neurotic
Put you on the news and tweet about ya
These bitches won't say nothin' sweet about ya
Can I get a witness? (Now) Can't get a witness (Now)
Just brainwashing motherfuckers is a dirty business

They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

While you on that Xbox, they closing in
You'll believe me when that front door is blowing in
They going in and they'll tackle everybody
Grandmama, grandbaby, shackle everybody
Interrupt your party, put down your drinks
Or they'll blow your nose off like the fucking Sphinx
Catch you by surprise around sunrise
When I go to sleep, I sleep with one eye
I sleep with one nine, I sleep with booby traps
And my dogs don't fuck with no Scooby snacks
I'm die-hard, I brought the movie back
Some of y'all try-hards, some of y'all don't do that
Some of y'all dumb as rocks, some of y'all sharp as a tack
Some of y'all clowns, some serious as a heart attack
I'ma fuck the police, nigga, yeah, I started that
Some of y'all scary niggas, come and be a part of that

They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

Underwater flow, shit is getting deep
Them fuckers tried to drown the aqua boogie freak
But I'm a octopus, especially when I got to push
When shit is fishy, my trigger finger get itchy
All you sissies, I'm a general like Ulysses
Fuck with me, I'm incredible like Bill Bixby
I never sleep, cut off my eyelids
Insomniac, maniac, I'm a hybrid
Bitch, I'm a pirate, they call me Blackbeard
I sail the seven seas, ho, I'm off the grid
It's the ultimate, baby, I'm the bulk of it
The whole package, a nigga with no baggage
It's kind of tragic when you driving through Irvine
Is this Germany, 1939?
I'm a gangsta boy, not the nerdy kind
They got a dirty mind, all about the dollar sign

They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak
They put the sheep to sleep
And dominate the weak

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
