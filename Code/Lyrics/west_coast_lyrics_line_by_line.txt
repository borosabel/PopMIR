what yeah want is an unexpected approach that may delay a suspects awareness of yeah presence until yeah have a chance to assist the situation yeah are confronted approach to danger don't move; it's hard to predict what will happen next drop the gun yeah could've prevented a tragedy yeah can approach but the danger light is blinking a self desctruct button is activated when i'm thinking this is a tribulation the weakened judge the prophecy was fulfilled cause i never budge i took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme they're seeing doubles of me but it wasn't a dream one vision was of life the other was death then i didn't give a fuck if death took yeah last breath so yeah burn in my pit that i call hell where yeah got send because yeah shit don't sell my twenty twenty was blurry from the smoke of the nigga that i burned and tormented but i didn't choke i started doing 'em i kept on doing 'em do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga ren was booing 'em and my presence to the suckers was of a stranger but fuck it they can approach to the danger if yeah can be seen yeah can be hit if yeah can be hit yeah can be killed fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangeler outrun the shot of a gun with a ganger murder in the first degree but it's worse to be a dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody with everybody thinking of death i kept working to be one of the last nigga left so many people looking for hope they're broke without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat a heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me so figuring to see the d e a d bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary so it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for nigga wishing but they better take caution before dre goes off and starts killing motherfuckers just in order to change the anger for the real nigga when i approach to danger approach the motherfucking danger come back to hell and send me some time final approach to danger death destruction around every corner another dead body and yeah wanna keep running but even the rain turns black all yeah can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search light no prison nobody makes bail everybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail think about death taking yeah last breath heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left for so many ways to stay up i gotta get mine even though they wanna make a crime yeah i'm being real a better or latter in the beginning because it will release the fucking police fuck 'em i approach to danger cause i don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up so yeah might as well kiss yeah ass goodbye cause in the long run

this song will discuss four main parts of the brain the cerebrum the cerebellum the limbic system and the brain stem and one individual's use or misuse of these parts inside my head or inside my brain is that part of me which keeps me sane which helps me discern between right and wrong and other things i'm gonna talk about in this song it's time for the people to know so now i tell 'em what goes in my cerebrum and my cerebellum the though process that helps me get dressed get up and go to school sit down and take a test it helps me determine if a girl is fine and the steps necessary to make her mine it tells me if something is cold or hot and i don't mess it up with crack coke or pot it helps my hearing taste touch and sight and smell so that i can tell that everything's alright it tells me when to get up and when to go to bed this is some of what goes on inside my head inside my head i wonder what might happen if the day came and i stopped rappin' would i still have friends or be all alone do they like me for me or for the microphone and also when i go on a date to a fancy resteraunt a hundred dollars a plate and people stare is it because they recognize me or are they knee jerk reacting to what they see i'm sorry let me make it somewhat clear do they look with joy or do they look with fear do they think 'oh wow yeahng mc is near' or do they think 'yeah get that nigga out of here' i don't know it's an unfortuante case that i can't read yeah mind when i see yeah face but on the other hand yeah can't read mine so i guess that the status quo's just fine for instance say i'm in a tall building looking out the window what if i illed and jumped out would it really matter to some and if they had my funeral just who would come would they cry for me after i was gone well don't worry that's not how i'm gonna move on cause i wanna go to heaven after i am dead but this is what i goes on inside my head the cerebrum is the part of the brain which is responsible for thinking reasoning problem solving and initiating resposes to external stimuli it is comprised of four lobes: the frontal which is concerned with speach and voluntary muscle activity the partietal which is concerned with the interpetation of sensory stimuli the temporal which is concerned with auditory stimuli or hearing and the occipital lobe which is concerned with the interpetation of visual stimuli it is the development of the cerebrum in humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures only whales and dolphins have comparable cerveal development inside my head pretty women reign supreme because they enter my live and dominate my dreams i see one walking down the avenue freely and i look her up and down hoping that she don't see me then i wonder what if the girl just stopped threw me on the ground and she got on top and moved and grooved until our bodies were slick then i stop and say 'man that's sick' but i'm not alone in this train of thought alot of people think it but they don't get caught they just live their lives and keep it all inside another secret that the brain will hide right i wonder what it's like to live life wild i wonder which women will have my child will i be a good parent or will i be cold then i imagine i'm five yeahs old i'm running down the street without a care in the world puberty's later so i don't think about girls mom and dad will do whatever i say they think it's really cute to see their son play responsibility is like a four letter word they say they told me something i'll say i never heard forget growing up i'll be a kid instead because this is what goes on inside my head the cerebellum is located below the octipal lobe and behind the brain stem it takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into coordinated muscle movements any msucualr acticity from brute strenght to a steady had requires a high degree of cerebellur input the brain stem is located just above the base of the skull and is the continuious connection between the brain and the spinal cord the lowest part of the brain stem or the medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullah's lowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states inside my head there are so many questions to answer and self doubt grows in my mind like cancer but i make sure that my thoughts are pure and my self confidence is like a cancer cure so someone tell me why i think i'm fat when none of my friends ever think like that and could it be i'm not as ugly as i feel because alot of women think i've got sex appeal and is it true that i'm just too commercial not black enough cause i'm not controversial is it true what religious fanatics tell if i don't go to yeah church then i'm going to hell and is it true that i'm obliged to try to please everyeahne with music i supply and is it true that it will make me strong if i sleep with a women cause she likes my song and is it true that i'm not a real black man if i fall in love with somebody who needs a tan and is it true that i have to try to be some type of superhero cause i'm yeahng mc and is it true that i have to watch myself because i think about sex more than anyeahne else and is it true that every women is fake 'cause she don't like me for me but for the money i make and is it true that i must be out of place since pop radio likes me i'm ignoring my race and is it true what some people will complain that since i made this song i must be insane hell no these are just negative thoughts and i just ignore them so i won't get caught i let my heart lead and my brain be led because this is what goes on inside my head the limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the brain stem and below the cerebrum it is concerned with emotional tone habitual tendencies sexual behaviour and desires and is closely associated with the cerebrum this association provides an inhibition for the raw emotional output of the

"give me a little push ok it's a boy aaaaaaaahhh let's get ready to rumble yeahhh a child is born a new life starts a baby given to those who have heart a gift from god to a woman and man and for the first few yeahs it's according to plan i go to school and i make the grade mom and dad work hard to get paid i'm gonna be a lawyer or sumpin close i got a lot of potential so i'm makin' the most my friends are real cool we fight and make noise but that's how it is because boys will be boys but i made one friend that i should never have had cause after that day everything went bad the friend i speak of is a kid named joe he sold drugs heavy and he clocked much dough he had a good family just like mine and he was a drug dealer but he came out fine now joe has class and joe has style and although his lifestyle is somewhat wild he has things i only hope to get and my parents say ""son we can't afford that yet so i see joe chillin' with the women and the clothes and the dough he is large like trump and i'm tiny like tim so part of me wants to be just like him so we eventually became friends and he told me how i can make my ends do what i do and follow my lead and yeah'll clock big dollars boy yes indeed make a quick run to a guy named pat he has a heavy habit but the boy lives phat yeah got nothin' to lose and everything to gain and that began my life yeah'll in the fast lane life in the fast lane c'mon so i went into pat's neighborhood for five minutes work two hundred dollars was good my bike was old and i was truly in need so with the money i could go and get a ten speed i rang the bell and pat came out the man was a junkie there was no doubt there were needles everywhere and the place smelled bad complete with empty vials from the drugs he had now sellin' heroin to pat was my duty though he had more tracks in his arm than a studio so right then and there i was positive that i would never in life turn out like pat now that's when the drug addict spoke to me and i thought that he would tell a funny joke to me but instead he had a serious look on his face and even though his life was a waste he told me ""yeah look like a really smart yeahng man get out of this drug life when yeah can if yeah don't go now and use yeah head this life will kill yeah and yeah'll wind up dead "" i ran out the house cause the vibe was spooky and all those drugs must've made pat kooky because i knew that i was good at what i did and nobody was smarter than this kid so joe introduced me to a man named pete see i was just a runner he was king of the streets he gave me jobs to run so i ran and then boom i was pete's right hand man he took me out to dinner one night he said stick with me and i will do yeah right yeah're a really smart kid with a hell of a brain another chapter of life yeah'll in the fast lane life in the fast lane c'mon so i'm chillin' with pete and everything goes well pat was wrong and baby i could tell cause money was flowin' and everything was cool i was eighteen now so i was done with school i graduated the choice wasn't tough for me because peter had a job lined up for me yeah know a nine to five would've been ok but what they make in a month i clock in a day so now i'm an entrepreneur sellin' product that is rich and pure i won't get caught cause i got too much sense and if i do i'll get off on my first offense i even tried crack for the first time the stuff was crazy and it blew my mind but havin' a problem doesn't bother me cause i deal the stuff so i get mine free i move out the house ""bye mom and dad "" they said they were happy but yeah they looked so sad man parents are hard to figure out indeed i thought they'd be happy to see their son succeed but anyway i had other problems arisin' with peter cuttin' into my enterprisin' i was mad as hell but i did not ill i said the man hooked me up so i should just chill well life in the fast lane makes yeah crazy keep on movin' and don't get lazy and every time i felt like i wanted to quit i pulled the pipe out and then i took a hit livin' this life is hard for me because peter has no regard for me yeah me and him are goin' through some strain with problems from life yeah'll in the fast lane life in the fast lane c'mon so now pete smooth played me out like a gopher his butler maid delivery boy and chauffeur ""go here go there get this get that spend it "" i thought it was time that this madness ended i heard he got his stuff from el salvador and i was sick of him treating me like a labrador so i used the money that was meant for rent so i could front the stuff and it was money well spent so now the fast lane seems to be mine cause i'm rollin' real quick in between the lines in a couple of weeks i was bigger than joe chillin' with the women and the clothes and the dough i ran into one of my homeboys herbie who told me news that would soon disturb me my man stepped to me and began to speak sayin' ""peter got shot by the cops last week and joe was there and he got shot too "" and i didn't know what the hell i'd do if he's in the hospital i can't go see him and if he's in jail then i can't go free him so i smoke but i didn't realize that as every day went by i was more like pat doin' rock after rock and i did not rest man i was suckin' on the pipe like a baby on a breast so i went out so i could work my trade with pete and joe gone i could really get paid but a plain clothes cop spotted me one day hopped in our cars and we were on our way a hundred miles an hour speedin' down the block and in the front seat was a bag full of rocks then a car came out and on the brakes i slammed but not matter what i did i got hit damn i turned the key but the car won't start and i could hear the beating of my heart i didn't have a rabbits foot or a four leaf clover but i had luck because the car turned over zoom and i was off again cause i didn't want yeahs in the federal pen and i didn't wanna be in the morgue with a tag on my toe that's not the way the stories gonna go so i lost him he could not find me so i pulled over cause he wasn't behind me i started smokin' rocks like a man possessed and then i felt this pain in my chest i tried to breathe but the air won't come i tried to scream out and that was dumb i couldn't do nothin' i was frozen with pain and that was the end of my life yeah'll in the fast lane"

"a child was born in the east one day moved to the west coast after his parents passed away never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats in poetry he was considered elite became a yeahng gangster in the streets of l a lost connections with his true roots far away but no matter the job or crime he never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme new yeahk's hip hop movement broke loose dj's cut records raps had the juice since busting rhymes was his natural thing he was crowned the west coast mc king but after his inauguration there was a rush of wack rappers with one intention to crush this master rapper and take his throne a simple job he had no crew he stood all alone assassins came in groups of one through five with raps no mortal mc could survive but he showed no mercy he rapped blood thirsty battling from friday on through to thursday never losin a bout never ending in doubt every confrontation k o knock out on his never ending journey to the t o p the l a player m c ice t magnificent rhymer i'm the ill beat designer if they ask yeah if i'm def don't front and say kinda merciless meticulous so fresh it's ridiculous i'm raised in the heart of los a n g e l e s king word connector the vocal projector yeah girl tried to jock me i had to reject her always adventurous voice some say is sensuous now i'm on the mic so i think i better mention this i don't like gucci fila louie or fendi those are fads and i ain't trendy but whether yeah name's lucy terry laura or cindy ice got beef and this ain't wendy's bust a move while i'm talkin' sucker rappers i be stalkin' when they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin' they slow down turn around and ask was that ice then they see me cold countin' my cash rhyme pays moves must be busted girls can't be trusted i looked at yeah lady and i was disgusted came into the party just to rock the place and yeah big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face i don't mean to diss her but do yeah kiss her look at her lips she got them crazy blisters body that smells like the new yeahk mets arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat i hope this something that yeah never forget tie that freak outside next time yeah come in the set because my jams be crazy packed with all fly ladies i'm talkin' def girlies and i don't mean maybe the way i rhyme no one will ever slay me and i ain't lyin' rhyme do pay me rhyme pays i'm notorious i'm infamous like a snake i'm venomous for those who may diss i think yeah should consider this i can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle but this record is for radio s t e r e o it not to be banned or for some underground mix show my hearts in my pen every time i begin sometimes my lyrics go crazy and i just can't control em my friend i try to edit what i'm rappin' about but i can't write polite my anger just jumps out perpetrators in the business claim their hard as hell talkin' that gangster shit know'n they're soft as jell  oh i better chill out before i ill out and my negative potential just might spill out and then this record won't be gettin played i'll save that rap for another day  rhyme pays  the front stage area goes into hysteria as i start to rhyme and unleash my criteria of what is to come during the beat of the drum and evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb using his intricate moves the record stays in the groove my boy cuts like jason it's easy to prove that evil e is the great his cuts are real not fake not emulated effects or a play back tape so suckers witness yeah fate while evil demonstrates i'm bout to get off this mic e  dog the break   kick it like me if yeah want'a diss me if yeah're gonna but my jam will still be kickin' on yeah neighborhood corner as my bass is max'n out the v u s on yeah box there'll be no doubt within yeah mind whether this mc do rock like granite i planned it so yeah could understand it if someone's talkin' when i'm rhymin' then just say ""damn shut up "" while ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin' maybe they're just jealous of the dollars i'm makin' but yeah're down with me yeah know god gifted me black kids say i'm trech white kids say i'm nifty spell out my name yeah go i c e t but right now it's time for evil e to hit me rhyme pays buys my food every night and day it pays my rent my bills i guess i'm doin' ok but when i say rhyme pays i mean in different ways cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day it makes me feel real nice when someone likes the ice or some yeahng mc asks me for advice but there will always be rappers who hate ice t maybe i dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy inevitable situation sucker rapper frustration i rhyme too tough to bite too intricate for notation syllables jumble competitors crumble as they witness mic attack and the microphone rumbles like hurricane i maim sometimes i go insane step toward my rap and i inflict the pain no shame ice capital t's my name damn there i go illin' out again rhyme pays"

upon intial contact with ice t's music i had envisioned him to be an ill  mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jaargon shocking sexual audacity and repulsive images of the ghetto however after further analysis of his music i can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestblishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle but to make things more plain and simple to the lymn i find ice t to be the dopest flyist o g pimp hustler gangster plyer hardcore motherfucker living today to be honest i'm totally and irrevocably on his dick
i'm rollin' up in a big gray bus and i'm shackled down myself that's who i trust the minute i arrived some sucker got hit shanked ten times behind some bullshit word in the pen the fool was a snitch so without hesitatin' i made a weapon quick if found a sharp piece of metal taped it to a stick then a bullhorn sounds that means it's time for chow my first prison meal the whole feeling was foul it wasn't quite my style but my stomach growled so i flushed the shit down and hit the weight pile the brothers was swole the attitudes was cold felt the tension on the yeahd from the yeahng and the old but i'm a warrior i got my ground to hold so i studied the inmates to see who hd the power the whites the blacks or just the gun tower in a blink of an eye a riot broke out blacks put their backs to the wall cause it was north and south a gun man shouts and everybody had doubt until the bullets started fly'n took two men out thn they rushed everybody back to their cells damn the pen is different than the county jail i'm in a one man cell i know my life's on a scale i wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell this is my second day i got a ten yeah stay i learned my first lesson in the pen yeah don't plaay i saw a brother kill another cause he said he was gay but that's the way it is it been that way for yeahs and when his body hit the ground i heard a couple of cheers it kind of hurt me inside that they were glad he died and i ask myself just who had the power the whites the blacks or just the gun tower yeah see the whites got a thing the call white pride the blacks got the muscle mexicans got the knives yeah better be wise yeah wanna stay alive go toe to toe with a sucka no matter wht size a fool tried to sweat me act'n like he was hard i stuck him twice in the neck and left him dead in the yeahd it was smooth how i did it cause nobody could see with my jacket on my arm and my knife on the side of me bam bam it was over another one bites the dust i went crazy in the pen with nobody to trust bench'n ten quarters so i'm hard to sweat used a tat gun and engrved my set they call me a lifer cause i'm good as dead i live in the hole so the floor's my bed and i ask myself again who has the power the whites the blacks or just the gun tower

now in my yeahnger days i used to sport a shag when i went to school i carried lunch in a bag with an apple for my teacher 'cause i knew i'd get a kiss always got mad when the class was dismissed but when it was in session i always had a question i would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and help me with my problem it was never much just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch oh how i wish i could hold her hand and give her a hug she was married to the man he was a thug his name was lee he drove a z he'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock i was on her jock yes indeedy i wrote graffiti on the bus first i'd write her name then carve a plus with my name last on the looking glass i seen her yesterday but still i had to let her pass she keeps on passin me by when i dream of fairytales i think of me and shelly see she's my type of hype and i can't stand when brothers tell me that i should quit chasin' and look for something better but the smile that she shows makes me a go getter i haven't gone as far as asking if i could get with her i just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture i'm shootin for her heart got my finger on the trigger she could be my broad and i could be her but all i can do is stare back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare now she's more sophisticated highly edu ma cated not at all over rated i think i need a prayer to get in her boots and it looks rather dry i guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye although she's crazy steppin i'll try to stop her stride cause i won't have no more of this passin me by time for me to voice my opinion of not even pretendin she didn't have me strung like a chicken chase my tail like a doggie she was kind of like a star thinking i was like a fan dude she looked good down side: she had a man he was a rooty toot a nincompoop she told me soon yeah little birdie's gonna fly the coop she was a flake like corn and i was born not to understand by lettin her pass i had proved to be a better man she keeps on passin me by now there she goes again the dopest ethiopian and now the world around me be gets movin in slow motion when ever she happens to walk by   why does the apple of my eye overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much i try wait no i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance; and i was so low key that she was unaware of my existance from a distance i desired secretly admired her; wired her a letter to get her and it went: my dear my dear my dear yeah do not know me but i know yeah very well now let me tell yeah about the feelings i have for yeah when i try or make some sort of attempt i symp damn i wish i wasn't such a wimp 'cause then i would let yeah know that i love yeah so and if i was yeah man then i would be true the only lying i would do is in the bed with yeah then i signed sincerely the one who loves yeah dearly ps love me tender the letter came back three days later: return to sender damn she keeps on passin me by
