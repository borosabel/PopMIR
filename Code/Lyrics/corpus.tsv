many mc 's be mislead mislead by the lie that they pump in their head the money and the fame that they be hope to find will never come close to the scope of my rhyme now some have be succesful but really and yeah these mc 's be clearly not nearly up to this level or should I say caliber because I be hype that the company 's sell I because they will take a dud talk some crud and then push he but in the next yeah someone new will just squoosh he because when yeah sell out to appeal to the masse yeah have to go back and enroll in some class so cash in yeah check 'cause it be the last one yeah get the table have turn and now yeah be not in effect so jet to the rear and yeah well just follow 'cause what be here today maybe go tomorrow here and go in a flash some make cash while other sucker go break real fast some never make any money but still they act funny like they be think they be run thing wear ring and medallion then listen to their rhyme when we rather take valium 'cause swiftness and skill they be lack so I send they pack they should have know not to tax in and smash all of the vocal to smithereen watch they collect themselves 'cause they   but some find happiness while other find sorrow and what be here today maybe go tomorrow

upon intial contact with ice t 's music I have envision he to be an ill   mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind whose rap display nothing but ridiculous jaargon shock sexual audacity and repulsive image of the ghetto however after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he be the epitome of antidisestblishmentarianism who embody the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle but to make thing more plain and simple to the lymn I find ice t to be the dop flyist o g pimp hustler gangster plyer hardcore motherfucker live today to be honest I be totally and irrevocably on his dick
