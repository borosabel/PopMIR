There are too many MC's who are overrated You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is So give it up, become a actor or a actress Or a producer, cause you fail to use the Mic right, so take flight before I bruise ya For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract Hey yo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin games I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names But deep down inside you know who you are Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar And that really gets on my nerve When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve Goin platinum and don't have no soul Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold I don't like the way it's goin down Because it should be the other way around I don't understand it I don't understand it I don't understand it How MC's take this rap game for granted MC's - what's goin on? I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform One minute you're hardcore and raw That's what you was known for, but not no more You changed, you rearranged You're not the same, your raps are blame That explain why you lost your fame Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops You turned pop, now you no longer gain props Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack So MC's, don't ever step out your range Remain the same And only change with the time Unless you get dropped like a dime Go for yours like I'm goin for mine But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper And never try to look or even sound like another rapper Just fulfill your own needs Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin beeds?

Like a flag at half-mast as frames click fast Not a thing will last as past is past Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn Used over and over till they were tired and torn Like a broken clock that can't tell time Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand Like a band that planned and planned and planned And flew down like a raven in the dark of night And snatched up the worm helpless to fight And brought it back to the nest, singing microphone check One two one two, this is just a test One two one two, this is just a test One two one two, this is just a test Like sand in one hand You can't hold for long Like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong It's like fudge and caramel, they're not the same And it's a shame, all you talk is game You act like a diamond waiting to be set In a gold ring, as if, I bet As time goes by in this give and take As long as I learn I will make mistakes Now, what do I want? What do I need? Why do I want it? What's in it for me?

I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise To the interconnectedness that underlies The lies upon lies have lost their meaning The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being Over and over, I fall, I learned to walk from a crawl It's not sad, it's just the way and the purpose of it all Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt I steal feels from reels, but I pay my respects Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings I give in and I win, I try to never complain Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage But I'll remain sane, making gain without pain Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain And keep it positive as painstaking as it is I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live So like a cloud carries rain, I'm gonna carry my rhyme Coming like thunder with lightening timing No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans Ferment time like wine, no ploys or scams Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas Woke up this morning right out of a dream Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme What can I do with these bones and flesh? With these animated thoughts in a world repressed? I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Garvey, and King His Holiness and all enlightened beings I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone I'll be the one who brings it inside your home But the words ain't mine, I just pass 'em along For Betty Williams and her friends, I sing this song And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes And more crimes are committed as I say these lines Youth enough, we put down the gun
Electrify, ele-electrify, electrify Electrify, ele-electrify, electrify Electrify, ele-electrify Words coming forth like water from the tap Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle It's just the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles Scandelescent in the means, I have dreamed on the schemes Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes So can I get a witness to testify? Open your eyes, realize, electrify Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify Electrify, electrify, ele-electrify So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes It's times like these, I'll just go with the decisions of the masses And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong Whilst all around me, those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed A set back ain't all that much problem to invade So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed Can I get a witness to testify?

As I develop the awakening mind I praise the Buddhas as they shine I bow before you as I travel my path To join your ranks, I make my full-time task For the sake of all beings I seek The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap Respect to Shantideva and all the others Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers I give thanks for this world as a place to learn And for this human body that I know I've earned And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing There's nothing here that's not been said before But I put it down now so that I'll be sure To solidify my own views And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too If others disrespect me or give me flak I'll stop and think before I react Knowing that they're going through insecure stages I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience I'll see it as a chance to help the other person Nip it in the bud before it can worsen A chance for me to be strong and sure As I think on the Buddhas who have come before As I praise and respect the good they've done Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation We need other people in order to create The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate Situations that bring up our deepest fears So we can work to release them until they're cleared Therefore it only makes sense To thank our enemies despite their intent The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength A strength from within to go the length Seeing others are as important as myself I strive for a happiness of mental wealth With the interconnectedness that we share as one Every action that we take affects everyone So in deciding for what a situation calls There is a path for the good for all I try to make my every action for that highest good With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood So I pledge here before everyone who's listening To try to make my every action for the good of all beings For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond I vow to do my best, to do no harm And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara

Well, it's clear that the Earth was the one who lost We are one with her, as she is one with us It's unreal how she is treated so unjust As our planet grows smaller each and every day Everyone affecting everyone in every way We're all citizens of the world community All here together, and we're searching for unity Over the years I've grown and changed so much Things I know now, years ago I couldn't touch There are things I've done that I wouldn't do again But I'm glad that I did 'cause I learned from them I just try to stay present, right here, right now No worries, no fears, and without any doubts Well, it's about time, it's about time It's about time, it's about time, it's about time 'Cause in these times, these changing times A transition is occurring, and I am not blind As the pendulum swings, a new age we enter And with every swing, it draws closer to the center Yes, the storm before the calm and the wars that lead to love Things must run their course, so we push and we shove But we're here to work it out, in one way or another To find a mutual respect for ourselves and one another But the true key is a trust in self So when I trust myself, I fear no one else I took control of my life just as anyone can I want everyone to see it's in the palm of your hand The past is gone, the future yet unborn But right here and now is where it all goes on I know we can fix it, and it's not too late I give respect to King and his nonviolent ways I dream, and I hope, and I won't forget Someday I'm going to visit on a free Tibet Someday I'm going to see us all joined as one Because it would be too bad to blow it up before we're done 'Cause we long behind the rage, learning from the pain The love behind the tension like the sun behind the rain I'm sending loving light to all there is To all creation and the life we live I'm not preaching bullshit, just speaking my mind 'Cause I'm here now, and it's about time Well, it's about time, it's about time It's about time, it's about time, it's about time
Jeb, get away from the barbecue, man Don, get the hell away from that thing Dunce, give me a kiss Won't you come and give me a kiss?

My mother went away for a month-long trip Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship She made a big mistake by leaving me home I had to roam so I picked up the phone Dialed Ali up to see what was going down Told him I pick him up so we could drive around Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 My mother left a yard but I needed one more Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit Came to a toll, we paid and went through it Had no destination, we was on a quest Ali laid in the back so he could get rest Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half The sun had just risen on a dusty path Just then a figure had caught my eye A man with a sombrero who was four feet high I pulled over to ask were we was at His index finger he tipped up his hat "El Segundo, " he said, "my name is Pedro If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto" Needed civilization, some sort of reservation He said a mile south, there's a fast food station Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor Ali said, "Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for? " Anyway a gas station we passed We got gas and went on to get grub It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere Anywhere would have been better I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em Ali had the fruit punch When we finished we thought for ways to get back I had a hunch Ali said, "Pay for lunch" So I did it Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady She was a waitress there Put the wallet down and stared and stared To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed: "Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need? " I checked for keys and started to step What do you know, my wallet I forget Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man Lord, have mercy The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me I fell bad but he makes me feel badder Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound Three days coming and three more going We get back and there was no slack 490 Madison, we're here, Sha He said, "All right, Tip, see you tomorrow" Thinking about the past week, the last week Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack Of Shaheed, "We gotta go back" when he said "Why? " I said, "We gotta go 'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo" Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo Left my wallet in El Segundo Left my wallet in El Segundo I gotta get, I got-got ta get it

Brother, brother, brother, Lucien, you're like no other. Listen very close 'cause I don't like to boast. Instead, I'll tell the tale of a French who prevailed Through the Mr. Crazy Rabbits who were always on his tail. on sale, your rumour starts to wail. Get caught with stolen goods and you will go to jail. If you go to jail, then who will pay the bail? They'll put you back to France on a ship with a sail. Escargot, Lucien, you eat snails. From the Zulu nation, from a town called Paris, Came to America to find liberty. Instead of finding pleasure, all you found was misery, But listen, Lucien, you have a friend in me. Oh, luck luck will drive you butt baddy. Next time you get some wheels, make it a Caddy. In terms of doing good, I know you wish you really could, But listen, brother man, I really think you can. Succeed with the breed of the brothers on your back. It's the creme de la creme, and you can bounce with that. It'll take a minute, rice, so take my advice. Trust in us, and thus you trust in your life. Lucine, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien. You should know! Are you ready, Lu? This one is for you, Comin' from a true-blue, fits like a shoe. Como esta usted or como talle vu? Lucien, I'll leave it up to you. Voulez vous . Endez vous . Coo-coo . Les poo-poo Watch that lass, gonna backlash fast. Can you get a grip on the crackhead dip? Sold you a paper bag, guess he saw you comin', VCR from a neck-bone bummin', $10 brother, he was hummin' and strummin', Only had 20, he was livin' like ya slummin', Gave him the money, well, I thought that was somethin', Lookin' like a kid who was lost in crumbin'. Don't worry about a thing, I won't get specific. This is a song that is long and prolific. Think of the stuff that I said if you can. Figure it out, compute, understnad. No problemo, I'll help you with your demo If you go to the store for me. Lucien, I'm just kiddin'. You should know! You gotta get a grip on the missions you'll be takin', Not so much the mission, but you got crazy ignition. Sure, the sugar-babies wanna give you a chance With the French "savoir faire" and the sexy dance, But is she really fly, or is she a guy? I won't ask why, 'cause I know that you try. You try too hard, is that the answer to the riddle? Instead of doin' so much, why don't you do just a little? Boy, what a cad, I guess we shouldn't treat him bad. In fact, it would be nice if we understood him like A case of positionin' the feet in the shoes, Sympathetic reason in the case of the blues. Lucien is blue, even though he's really brown. I had to make the sound, his life is too profound. On the up-and-up, he's somethin' like a little pup, Young and naive, it's hard to believe. As long as you're strong, you can quest with the questers, Jolly like a jumping bean or a jester. Lucien, Lucien, Lucien, Lucien. You should know!
Q-Tip is my title. I don't think that is vital for me to be your idol, But dig this recital. If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissin', Slingin' this and that, 'cause this and that was missin'. Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected. Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected. Afrocentric livin', Africans be givin' A lot to the cause 'cause the cause has been risen. Some brothers, they be flammin', thinkin' we ain't slammin, Comin' off like the days where we used to wear the tans and A blue-colllar talker, a hemisphere stalker, A glass of O. J and a ten mile walk-a. If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearin', Can I get a beep and a side order of cheerin'? I am what I am, that's a tribal man. We all know the colours, we all must stand. As we start our travels, things they will unravel. "Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel. Won't be gone for long, listen to the song. If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is Push it along, push it along. Push it along, yeah, push it along. Put one up for the Pfeife, it's time to deceipher. The ills of the world make the situation lighter. The clock is always tickin', the systems should be kickin'. Like ham and eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken. Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever, Embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour? The wraughts of the rap filling up the gap With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap. The boom, the bip, the boom bip Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip. Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble. It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty, So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty. This ain't trial and error, more like tribe and error, Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror. The street can't depart from the bloody heart. Repair the wear and tear, don't start 'fore it starts. Won't be gone for long, listen to the song. If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is Marchin' off the project, we hope that you will subject. It's good to be an object and never, ever reject. The tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda, Keep it in boom and never will we slander. should be handed, don't let me demand it. Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit. Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it. Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it. Although she's flippin' crazy, give my love to Gracy. God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey? The pigs are wearin' blue, and in a year or two, We'll be goin' up the creek in a great big canoe. What we gonna do, save me and my brothers? Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers. Never will we do that and we ain't tryin' to rule that. We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black? This society of fake reality Are nothin' but a peg of informality. While I sing my song, sing it all day long, If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
Do I love you? Do I lust for you? Am I a sinner cuz I do the two?

But trudgin, we are used to You don't Quest alone, Quest with a crew We're four, once more, must make the tracks You see four fronts, but now you see four backs

L. , you're runnin late and it'is time to rock" Told Cut Creator what the order would be Then I said "Lord have mercy" and slapped hands with E Went on stage, I heard the girlies scream And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream Aah!
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself, "Look what you've done to her. " I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying, "Amor, " kissing you on the ear Whispering, "I love you and I'll always be here. " Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way 'til I'm old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy I need love I need love Romance, sheer delight, how sweet? I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say, "Ooh girl, you're so sweet. " It's déjà vu whenever I'm with you I could go on forever telling you what I do But where you at? You're neither here or there I swear I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen? Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean Fantasies can run, but they can't hide And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside I need love I need love I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you Grind, moan and never be alone If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad I've got money, but love's something I've never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man who's ten-feet tall I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something I'll never forget I need love I need love See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time 'Til we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive I'll search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl I need love I need love Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting I love you

I was at the mall, sipping on a milkshake Playing the wall, taking a break Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings Baby hair and bodies built to swing That's when I seen her, her name was Tina Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina I said, "How you doing? My name's Big L Don't ask me how I'm living, 'cause yo, I'm living swell" But then again, I'm living kind of foul 'Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl To make a long story short, I got the digits Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit I was spanking her and thanking her, chewin' her and doin' her Laughin' because my girl didn't know that I was screwin' her Laying like a king on sheets of satin That's what time it is, you know what's happening She had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie But Tina was exotic, Earl's my witness With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in And said to her with a devilish grin Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you I went to the high school about three o'clock To try to catch a cutie riding my jock My homeboy's jeep, the system blasting Cold forty dogs, smiling and laughing Girls all over, the kind I adore I felt like a kid in a candy store That's when I seen her, her name was Brenda She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember I said to my man, "Stop the jeep. " She's only seventeen but, yo, don't sleep I kicked the bass like an NFL punter And scoped the booty like a big game hunter I said to the girl, "Yo, you look tired Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire" I put the big booty on a bearskin rug She gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug I said to the girl, "Them young boys ain't nothing You wanna get freaky? Let me kiss your belly button" I circled it and teased it and made her squeal Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies Tina busted in my house while I was eating You know what I said "Too bad you caught me cheating but—" Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak Around the time when the waitresses were on their lunch break I pulled in the parking lot and parked my car Somebody shouted out "I don't care who you are" I paid it no attention, I walked inside Because Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride I walked in the place, everybody was looking And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cooking I sat down to eat, ordered my food I said to the waitress, "I don't mean to be rude But I'll take you on a platter" She said, "You got a girl? " I said, "It don't matter You look like you're tastier than a piping-hot pizza What's your name? " She said, "My tag says Lisa" I said, "Okay, you're smart and all that But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back" She looked at me and said "Make yourself clear L, where we going? " I said "Right here" She looked kind of puzzled, I said "You'll see" I pulled up at ten on the D-O-T When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat Laid her on the table and placed my order And gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter On and on to the break of dawn All over the restaurant, word is bond I heard somebody coughing, I checked my watch I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol Who did I see? Oh, yo, it was Brenda Yo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you

Peace
I came in the door, I said it before I never let the mic magnetize me no more But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line, Taking off my coat, clearing my throat The rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note My mind remains to find all kinda ideas Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build But still say a rhyme after the next one Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one And you know that I'm the soloist So Eric B, make 'em clap to this I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill No tricks in '86, it's time to build Eric B easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed Cuz to me, MC means move the crowd I made it easy to dance to this But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist Say "Indeed" then I proceed cuz my man made a mix If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix his fingertips, so I rhyme until there's no rhymes left I hurry up because the cut will make him bleed to death But he's kicking it cuz it ain't no half steppin' The party is live, the Rak can't be kept inside if he's eruptin' just like a volcano It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme Cuz I'm better then the rest of them Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim Go get a girl and get soft and warm, Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm But now it's out of hand cuz you told me you hate me And then you ask what have I done lately First you said all you want is love and affection Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection Take you out, buy you all kinds of things I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me Funky.
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you Without a strong rhyme to step to Think of how many weak shows you slept through Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss The rhymes from the microphone soloist And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon As you hear it, pump up the volume Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow, Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control your body to dance soul, Ditects the tempo like a red alert Reaches your reflex, so let it work When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago It can be done but only I can do it For those that can dance and clap your hands to it I start to think and then I sink Into the paper like I was ink When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines, I escape when I finish the rhyme. I got soul You got it I know you got soul Picture a mic, the stage is empty A beat like this might tempt me To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss Eric B. break the sticks Rakim will begin when you make the mix I'll experiment like a scientist You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list 'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold You want it next? then you gotta have soul 'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore Take the mic, make the people respond for The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be If you wanna get on after me Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme Forget it and don't waste your time 'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it This is how it should be done This style is identical to none Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me I drip steam like a microphone fiend Eager to MC is my theme I get hype when I hear a drum roll Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul You got it I got soul that's why I came To teach those who can't say my name First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller Rakim gets stronger as I get older Constant elevation causes expansion I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion Then put it on tape and in the city I test it Then on the radio the R's requested You listen to it, the concept might break you 'Cause almost anyone can relate to. Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles Or should I just let him melt? Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul You got it Now I'm a stop to see what you got Get off the mic before I get too hot I want to see which posse can dance the best It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound, The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound, Even other states come right and exact, It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at Since you came here, you have to show and prove And do that dance until it don't move 'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release, The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace You got it
Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this Fever, was it me or either summer madness Cuz I just can't stand around So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate Cuz When i heard the beat, I just had to make Something from the top of my head So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said How could I move the crowd First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed Here's the instruction, put it together It simple ain't it but quite clever Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years But weak ideas irritate my ears Is this the best that you can make? Cuz if not and you got more, I'll wait But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on The dancefloor when they put something smooth on So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud Cuz I like to move the crowd Move the crowd. Imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar, It gets stronger everytime I hold a Microphone, check the tone to get started The line for the microphone is departed So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing Everyone is moving or eager to listen Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut! Cuz I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut For those that know me, indeed I like to flow Especially when the music's going slow It gives me a chance to let everybody know It's time to bust out the Rakim show I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise Right in front of your eyes cuz I am a surprise So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve At 360 degrees, I revolve This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven, Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving Move the crowd.
Knowledge will begin until I finish this song 'Cuz the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on You sweat as you step about to get hype Or should you just listen to the man on the mic You're physically in this with me but how could you tell If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured Into the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored If you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand Holds and controls you 'til I leave You fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then Bring 'em to the front 'cuz my rhymes' the oxygen Then wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you Into your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue And so on and I'ma go on simultaneously And even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be Rising to the top - and I came to drop it Catch it and quiz it - is my topic Universual 'cuz I move everybody to come By exercising your mind you'll coincide as one You look around and see how packed the party starts to get I draw a crowd - like an architect The five borroughs react and all the islands attract And every state can't wait - so they attack off a spot on the floor - squeeze in cuz it's packed It'll be more room if MC's play the back I'm the R the A to the K-I-M If I wasn't, then why would I say I am The microphone fiend if I was a fake Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite Sung it on stage some said it don't sound like The voice on the record - I see what you mean Because the system was wack, so I had to scream So just - give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it If not - into the crowd I'll throw it Pull out my cordless mic and entertain you well Before I let go I'ma spark your brain cells I took time to write - tonight I will recite So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight Rhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin MC's are knowin' that's why they're goin Home to tell a friend when the party ends "Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again" Cuz mic by mic and stage by stage, Tape by tape and page by page, When the crowd is moving I compete with the mix The rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets Deeper and Deeper - I hope you understand it I made it up myself and I planned it For other MC's who waste time Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme I cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating The rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin' To get up on the microphone and then start takin' Control of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it So hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet Attracted to a freestyle put in effect You listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet So Eric, pick up the needle put it in the middle Give me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little, I want you to hear this perfectly clear Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea? I hope you knowledge the beginning cuz I'm finished this song The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on.
Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar I'm letting knowledge be born and my name's the R A-K-I-M not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list That's what I'm saying, I drop science like a scientist My melody's in a code, the very next episode Has the mic often distorting, ready to explode I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze emcees then make 'em colder The listener's system is kickin' like solar As I memorize, advertise like a poet Keep you going when I'm flowing, smooth enough, you know it But rough, that's why the mural on my story I tell will be Nobody beats the R, check out my melody So what, I'm a microphone fiend, addicted soon as I seen One of these four emcees so they don't have to scream I couldn't wait to take the mic, blow into it to test Then let my melody play, then the record suggest That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait I won't push, I won't beat around the bush I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to You might try but you can't get close to Because I'm number one, competition is none I'm measured with the heat that's made by Sun Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall They shouldn't have told me you said you control me So now a contest is what you owe me Pull out your money, pull out your cut Pull up a chair, and I'ma tear shit up My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for "Ra" Switch it around, it still comes out "R" So easily will I E-M-C-E-E A repetition of words, just check out my melody Some bass and treble is moist, scratching and cutting a voice And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice I wouldn't have came to set my name and run the same weak shit Putting blurs and slurs and words that don't fit in a rhyme Why waste time on the microphone I take this more serious than just a poem Rock from party to party, backyard to yard Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp I can swing off anything even a string of a harp Just turn it on and start rocking, mind no introduction 'Til I finish dropping science, no interruption When I approach, I exercise like a coach Using a melody and add numerous notes And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M It's attached, like a match, I will strike again Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped Put in a order to proceed with the momentum, except I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter Or pause, but don't stop the tape recorder I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor Melody arranger, poet et cetera Extra events, the grand finale like bonus I am the man they call the microphonist With wisdom, which means wise words being spoken Too many at one time, watch the mic start smoking I came to express the rap I manifest Stand in my way, and I'll veto all the word's protest Emcees that wanna be best, they're gonna Be dissed if they don't get from in front of All they can go get is me a glass of Moet A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet I take seven emcees put 'em in a line And add seven more brothers who think they can rhyme Well, it'll take seven more before I go for mine Now that's twenty-one emcees ate up at the same time Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doing No fessing, no messing around, no chewing No robbing or buying, biting—why borrow? This slob will stop trying, fighting to follow My unusual style will confuse you a while If I was water, I'd flow in the Nile So many rhymes, you won't have time to go for yours Just because of applause, I have to pause Right after tonight is when I prepare To catch another sucker duck emcee out there 'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe And after this you'll call me your majesty My melody Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorized it Eric B. made a cut and advertised it My melody's created for emcees in the place They try to listen 'cause I'm dissin' them, so pick up your face Shook off your neck as you try to detect my pace Now you're druggin', almost buggin' off my rhyme, like bass The melody that I'm styling, smooth as a violin Rough enough to break New York from Long Island My wisdom is swift, no matter if My momentum is slow, emcees still stand stiff I'm genuine like leather, inclined to be clever Emcees you beat the R, I'll say "oh never" So Eric B. cut it easily and Check out my melody

Planet Earth was my place of birth Born to be the SOLE controller of the universe Besides the part of the map I hit first Any a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst The rough gets going, the going gets rough When I start flowing, the mic might bust The next state, I shake from the power I generate People in California used to think it was earthquakes 'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled But it seems like I'm locked in hell Looking over the edge but the R never fell A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip Stand on my own two feet and come equip Any stage I'm seen on, I'M LIKE A PHENOM I stand alone and need nothing to lean on Going for self wit a long way to go So much to say but I still flow slow I come correct and I won't look back 'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at Even the I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York And return through the womb of the world as a thought Thinking how hard it was to be born BEING EQUIPPED wit no physical form Millions OF CELLS wit one destination To reach the best part, it's life creation 9 months later, a job well done Make way, 'cause here I come Since I made it this far, I can't stop now There's a will and a way and I got THE know-how To be all I can be and more And see all there is to see before I'M Called and go back to the essence It's alot to learn so I study my lessons I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me I'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me 'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves ExileD from the original man, a straight way Now that's what I call hard times I rather be here to exercise the mind Then I take a thought around the world twice From knowledge NEWBORN back to knowledge precise Across the desert, that's HOT AS THE ARABIAN But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian REaching for the city OF Mecca, visit Medina Visions of Neffertiti then I seen a Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa Return the thought through the eye of a needle For miles I thought and I just fought the people Under the dark skies on a dark side Not only there but right here's an apartheid So now is the time for us to react Take a trip through the mind and when you get back Understand you're third eye seen all of that It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at Even the Even the No more props, I want property In every borough, nobody's stopping me Because I'm thorough, rhymes are making real estate for me to own Wherever I bless a microphone 007 is back and relaxing On POINT N' reactin' and ready for action I'm so low key that you might not see me Incognito and taking it easy Quiet, it's kept on a hush hush In front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush Be calm, keep a low pro, and play the background HOPIN' the wack rapper'LL put the mic back down So rip it, break it in half, go head and slam it 'Cause when it's time to build, I'm a mechanic I'm bonding and mending, attaching and blending So many solos, there is no ending People in my neighborhood, they know I'm good From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood Footprints remain on stage ever since As I walk the street, I leave fossils and dents When I had sex, I left my name on necks My trademark was left throughout the projects I used to get rich when I played celo When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know So I collect my cash then slide I got my back, my gun's on my side It shouldn't have to be like that I guess it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at Even the I'm from the Word up, peace
Run for cover. Here I go again, ready to flow again. Better HOPE my mic don't blow again. Warned by alarms when the mic gets warm. Crowd'll get critical, can't keep calm. Jet for the exit, why hang around? Words that I found make the mic melt down. If you stay, better cooperate, cuz I amputate, and whoever don't break, I'm-a suffocate. Leave 'em with asthma, you better pass the mic to the massacre master who has the power to build and destroy at the same time, so track the wack at the right, and exact could shine. Meant to beat overheat, but I won't stop, so evacuate the spot when the mic's hot. Switch it from one hand to another, and that's a hint, my brother, run for cover. Cuz I'm armed, my brain contains a bomb, as if I escaped from Vietnam. Some people label me lethal, lyrics I made then put beats to. Format, collapse your lungs twist your tongues, you can't bump your gums off of none of the drums. Words that I made'll create an iller scene, Eric B. is the fly human being on the guillotine. Hook 'em up to a respirator, cuz it's the Mista Suffocator. What I write is like shovin' a mic down your windpipe. Don't let him bitE rhymes Rakim write. No mic-to-mouth resuscitation is neccessary; no obituary, and NOTHING LEFT TO BURY. As it strikes on the same mic twice and then, cut it on, and I'm-a strike again. I meditate off the breaks, till the place shakes, then I make rain, hail, snow and earthquakes. Speak the truth, tear the roof off the mother. The stage is stompin' grounds -- run for cover. Evacuate the building, danger, cuz I came to explain the strategy that'll be tragic automatically, havin' me to cause another catastrophe. All you gotta do is give Rakim the microphone and the crowd'll yell "Timber. " Buildings collapsin', rappers gettin' trapped in, areas closed off, no one gets back in. So set up roadblocks, barrIcade the doors, fade, put a detour sign on the stage. Hold my microphone as evidence, the weapon I use and been usin' ever since the days in the park when, rap was an art then. Plus I was dominant, determined and dark-skinned. Makin' it hard to walk the streets at night for those who talk the weak beats on the mic. Whoever's livin' large better wear camouflage. Prepare to be bumrushed when I yell charge. Surround by sound of the beat-down another brother, this is stompin' grounds, run for cover. Wheels or foot, better not stay put. Whole place shook till the mic's unhooked. Then you've got seven minutes to vacate the premises. Lyrics'll echo soon as the break finishes. Don't act wild, single file to the door. No need for an encore, just clear the floor. Cuz my mic's about to self destruct, the stage'll blow up when my rhymes erupt. So make sure the place is cleared out and abandoned, cuz minutes from now it won't be standin'. Then send out and A. P. B. : All Poets Beware of a brother like me. Now how many rhymes could your man manufacture? How many bitin' MCs can I capture? Trap rappers who try to run off at the mouth; take over their route, play 'em out like a Cub Scout. So leave troopin' for MCs at war, and if it's a battle let the crowd keep score. Cuz me and the drummer make drama, and that's word to mother. run for cover.
I came to set em straight, and let em know Whoever's holdin the best, just let him go Cause here's the inside scoop on the fiend They wanna know why I'm seldom seen Cause who needs the TV screens and magazines or shootin through the city in fly limousines There's one thing I don't like, it's the spotlight . cause I already got light They be like, "Yo we had a get together last week and we know everyone was there except the Black Sheik" Because my schedule is tight, I gotta write I'm deep in the archives, and keepin em hyped It's been a long time, since you heard a strong rhyme None of these are weak so when you bite on mine we can trace the hits and then name that style MC'sll be out of a job for a while I reposess your indentification So hand in your application Put your mic on strike until you're unemployed Contract is up and I'm stampin it void Your selection ain't that selective So I'ma put you in your proper perspective On the dancefloor, and doin the SHAKE Ready to let em brake, set em straight Somebody said I set em up and pulled the plug on em But instead I let em go on so I could bug on em Go 'head and flow, cause I close the show Swing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow For instance. once I commence. . the crowd is convinced So now you know who to put your money on Hurry up, before your money's gone Cause I'm the most common denominator Orchestrate a rhyme much greater I'm like a world almanac, so tell the media Givin em information like encyclopedia So bring a dictionary, so you can look it up so you know what I mean, when I hook it up No misconceptions although I complicate but this concept'll set em straight They even said that I was locked in jail So now I guess I'm out on bail? The only Island I was on was the Strong one And if I did my bid, it'll be a long one Cause if I sold weight, I'd be upstate in the penile, waitin for a brake Cause sellin drugs is for handicaps I got too many skills besides bustin rough raps If I go to jail, it won't be for sellin ki's It'll be for muderin MC's The beat'll take over your heart, then I start to cut em in half, cause rhymes are razor sharp Secure the exits, all MC's remain Cause we got a crowd to entertain And I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous Brain'sll bust, what you tryin to explain to us? You got lost, and couldn't go on Came up short, so here's one to grow on Elevate off a high IQ In time, you'll find I'm true Cause once I start on a piece of art from sun to moon and light to dark I build the Ark Now you can float off the rhymes I wrote I'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat You could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked Attacked with a torpedo, what did you expect? Driftin up the creek, without a beat or a paddle Castaway on a raft and stand fragile Rescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job Me and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard Dealin with actual facts it sold out fat here and now, but I go so far back to bring you up to date, so we can elevate It's no time to wait, or anticipate Cause I'm never late, I'm gonna motivate So I can let em brake, and set em straight
This is poetry in motion Try to catch on, stay close to the host and MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin Ladies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion Hit spots soothin, can't stop movin Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin When I detain it's a brainstorm never the same form, every brain I rained on is warm Takin a trip through Memory Lane to Melody See if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's could do you justice, but you can't touch this Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed I'm universal and much more merciful So versatile with the style it's reversable I get away even if I say a curse or two First, let me bust another verse for you Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit You don't want no kind of conflict Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped Pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip Everything I said flows since my intro I plant a thought extend and then grow Holdin my pen tightly it might be Controversy at first when I write the chords of research don't just take it for granted When I'm gone my mind remains a planet If I keep buildin, and teach the children So when they read in between the lines it's filled in I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate till I'm deep awake, but not asleep At the same time risin and advertisin what is true, keep advised and you can stay wise and I'm untouchable Comin over the bridge take a peak at the skyline Cause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme My culture's makin me stronger, mentally Physically I'm powerful poetry now that could be labelled as art placed in a museum Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with nothin illiterate it's facts I build with My mind's untouchable which means intangible Contents never dense it's understandable I study life so I can live it the right way No time to hear what another brother might say Why sell a capsule of crack I don't have to I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to put message on records that's graced with hard bass Smugglin microphones, this ain't Scarface Whoever talked that talk, I wanna hawk And don't try to Escape From New York Cross a 110th Street lookin for a problem It's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em I hear the music clear as I get near the hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater Take a step back when I rap I step up to you. I'm untouchable Put on my thinking cap pump the track Test your reflex relax but in contact you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer you're supposed to keep your composure But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype it's like nitro opponents get petro Remember the trademark left by the R that's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest in effect, you could die-tect the imposter Takin my props, Rakim is still proper I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it Everything I say, coincide with the topic Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured Inside my brain it's all manufactured As we go deeper it's hard to find Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined in the mind with some kind of idea for the style I'm advertisin what is true Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind is untouchable
Me and the rap's laid back Nonchalant and relaxed in the track Put together well, so it ain't hard to tell Easy to recognize, so my records'll sell On the microphone, well known with a low tone Show and prove when the stage show is shown All you hear is screams when I'm hit by the laser beams Ladies fiend, rappers are choosin up teams So who could beat up, just before we meet up Before I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up to let you know, everything's under control Under surveillance, takin over your soul So let me handle this, gettin scandalous All my jams are hits, never plan to miss Crowd is captured, released at my permission Peep em, as I, keep em eager to listen Opponents are found paralyzed from the mic down Left with a little sight ears still hear the sound Try to clear your mind but it's still there Give him about a year, then give him a wheelchair I damage and deteriorate, til your brain dead No huss cuss what I discuss'll bust his head Here's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail You get scars, so you could read it in braille Close your third eye, then I do body work And I keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt My DJ'll sew up cuts like an M. D. And I still move crowds like an M. C. Entertain and tear you out of your frame Leave you in a puddle of blood, then let it rain Then I get deep, so try to withstand on my level to think, or sink like quicksand He couldn't hang, so I cut the rope short Watchin em fall, cause they need more support This is the way that I done, all of my competition Peep em, as I, keep em eager to listen Keep em eager to listen The performance I give em is, somethin like a hypnotism Swingin back and forth, til you can keep the rhythm At the tone of my voice, you will become eager to listen dance in a trance til you see the R on stage, no cheers, all ears All three of your eyes on me, so it appears just like you thought it would be, but even better Live and direct on stage, instead of the radio or video or studio rehearsin I'm at my best in the flesh in person The main attraction, center of attention The crowd'll go crazy, soon as I mention it's time to communicate, so let's conversate I get my point across, when you respond I make sense So now we could continue the mission As I, keep em eager to listen As I, keep em eager to listen I used to always say one day I'll play in the NBA cause I'll slay opponents well, and also excel as a black quarterback in the NFL I throw to score so I can hear the crowd roar Keep em, out of they seats and on the floor And when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline My record is undefeated, and I'll win again I'll never lose or hear boos from the audience cause they participate, and applaud me since I bring em what they want to hear And they'll fill up the atmopshere with people that came to party, and have a good time So when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme Because I promise to accomplish the mission Cause I, keep em eager to listen
Me and Eric B was coolin' at the Paladium Seen a all-world covered girl, I said "Hey lady I'm Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up Or interveen or interrupt, but. . . You got the look - I wanna get to know ya better I had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her 'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein' Almost looked Korean, but European. When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory - Even her body language told the story Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony I said "My name is Ra - and this is Eric B" Since the music was loud, I said "let's take a walk, So we could talk and see New York. Show time doesn't start until one o'clock And once I entered your mind I wouldn't wanna stop Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain Each mic is a mineral, poetry's protein Verse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said Over Me, She's goin' crazy She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy She said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony . . .

No more time to pass time 'cause these are the last rhymes, 'Cause we're living in the last times. They wanna go to war, more wars to come But most of us fight more wars than one Discrimination in the racial nation While they destroy our strong foundation Nature's balance is way off balance They tip the scale, now it's no more silence The hole in the ozone layer is outta control But they wanna fight for more oil and gold Unemployment, I got laid off The streets is the last resorts to get paid off For more, more mint, no doe for rent I gotta shed blood to make a red cent Maybe I should ask the president Somebody give me the president But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question 'Cause in my section it's worse than recession So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood Take from the bad and give to the good First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse 'Cause I need government and they need government Alot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects You're gonna get robbed and wrecked I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot Let's get him for all he got I approached him slow like I was a basehead Put the fo-fifth to his face and said You see those kids over there wit the hoods Walk to them real slow and give them the goods First the gun and the doe and crush the jumbos One false move and no one knows 'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread You good as dead, I'm a fill your head wit lead That's when I pushed him into his building To murder him . but I remember the children. We gotta teach the children everyday, keep a song Show them the light, teach them right from wrong Make some sense so they can carry on Teach the children We gotta teach the children so that they can sing along Understand the words in this song Can't be done when we're gone, so. " Teach the children , save the nation I see the destruction, the situation They're corrupt, and their time's up soon But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon Sounds like Total Recall But who gotta spaceship, you get it, we fall So hope for the best and expect the worst The end is near and it's U-N-I verse. The one's that interfere wit nature Labeled you limited and underrate ya, His plans over rule when he separates ya Now it's U-N-I verse, the one that hates ya So we gotta let them know, we're hip to the script Change the skit, or we're about to flip 'Cause we want access to happiness Livin' the good life and much success Equal opportunity Self awareness and unity Education, the kids need a sculpture Teach them the abacus and their culture. And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing Poison neighborhoods are illing But they import more keys from across seas A drug disease hits the streets wit ease So keep on building. 'cause we gotta keep building Till the answers are filled in And make sure you don't stop till then. And if you do, remember the children!
Sip the juice cuz I got enough to go around, And the thought takes place uptown I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk, And then taught to hawk New York- I go to Queens for queens to get the crew from Brooklyn, Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken, Go Uptown and the Bronx to boogie down, Get strong on the Island, recoupe, and lay around. Time to bulid my juice back up- Props back up, suckers get smacked up Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about Knocking niggaz off, knocking niggaz out Shaking em up, waking em up Raking em up, breaking em up. Standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge Let's see if I know the ledge Corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here I get cock-d liffin' forty's of beer; Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased, If I get revenge, then they rest in peace. Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one- And give a brother a fair one! Stay alert and on "p's". And I do work with these- like Hercules, Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw 'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall. Smooth but I move like an army Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me, Putting brothers to rest like Elliot ness 'Cause I don't like stress Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand Nutting's gonna stop the plan I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro Black Gambino, die like a hero Living on shaky grounds too close to the edge Let's see if I know the ledge! Shells lay around on the battleground Dead bodies are found throughout the town. Tried to put shame in my game to make a name, I'm a Put it on a bullet, put it in your brain. Rip the block like a buckshot, Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed, No remorse when a life is lost I paid my dues- paid the cost! . And my pockets are still fat, Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat. Even if my crew steep with one deep I attract attention, people like to peep So come say hi to the badguy Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die! 'Cause I get loose and I got troops And crazy juice! In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me. I'm at war alot, like Anwar Sadat. But no warning shot, my gun is warm alot. When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear, Areas in fear but this here's a fear! Living life too close to the edge Hoping that I know the ledge. A brand new morn, no time to yawn Shower's on, power's on Late for school, I catch the train Girls sip "Cristal" and whisper my name I push up like an exercise, Check the intellect and inspect the thighs Select the best one, pull her to the side Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool Just meet me after school, We can moan and groan until your mom come home , And you be calling me Al "dope" Capone. Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose- Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety Cause alot of niggaz hate me Coming out of the building, they set me up Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge I guess I didn't know the ledge.
Double oh seven is back. Double oh seven is back. Double oh seven is back. I don't stress my day cause it's best to parlay I guess you could say I've been away I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant and fourteen hands comb New York for fans They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread A mornin massage turnin into a real rough rubdown so I figured I'll lay around They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me They know more than calisthetics as they worked up a sweat It wasn't even ten o'clock yet Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean They sweetly keep me squeaky clean I chill as they filled the jacuzzi I said, "I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me Support my thoughts, cause I got a lot of writing to do" They said, "Cool, " and just enjoyed the view It ain't hard cause it's miles from the sidewalk I'm overlookin every borough in New York The entire, Empire, State to concentrate for every rhyme I make So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune And just before they all cleared the room they said, "We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure We wish you didn't have to leave no more" But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door Double oh seven is back. Rest assured Double oh seven is back. Feel secure Double oh seven is back. I'm fillin up the page when I'm steppin on stage Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air Fellas sayin HOE, everybody yellin GO Fly ladies in the house all screamin "awww yeah" That's how they react when I attack the mic In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright Girls love to squeeze me real tight Double oh seven is back. Ra has returned, to romance em, better than Johnny Handsome When I was young, women said, "Damn son" Ain't nuthin change but the year and I'm still here C'mere dear and let me whisper in your ear Hug my words so I can taste your lips I set up hips like domino chips but I don't let em hit the floor And if you got sore, then feel secure Where's the pain, is it the spot you set us in Almost magic, better than medicine Take one of these and put your mind at ease I get more work than a lot of M. D. 's If I'm hawkin New York, or out on tour I express the raw dialect and explore But don't get fooled by metaphor Double oh seven is back Rest assured Feel secure Rest assured Rest assured Yo, feel secure
Pass the hand grenade It's gonna blow 'cause I took out the pin Detach the detonator, data send Programmed wit protons, eqipped wit predicates Electrons and elements just fit Your pronoun hits the ground and that's that Hit the floor like a meteor so get back Commas, punctuation marks separate, it sparks Follow the course in to avoid getting sharked More volts than a lightning bolt: handle with care! I'm far from fragile, warfare won't tear I'm armed and dangerous, trained for combat Let off rounds and they won't just bomb back Explosions I made to invade your parade- your weak beats' decay 'till they can't get played! Wrong elements in the mic, they get sprayed Pass the hand grenade After the stage gets warm, I heat it up The crowd gets charged, I speed it up They couldn't get warm, gimme a cut The rhyme gets good, so eat it up Food for thought until your thoughts is sore, Fill up a colosseum, I can serve them all Bake another plate, and cook it far from raw And if your overweight, then here's some more. 'Cause every dish I make tastes great and Plus filling, If I sold a third of my rhymes, I make a killing, Get the salt and pepper from the maid Get the blood off the blade, pass the hand grenade If you try this, your response is tonsilitis, I'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis; You got the slightest ideas, I got the brightest Here's the lightest, so clear, it's out of sight, it's Darkness, from the darkness, came the light The night is the time for Ra to recite it. Educated, but complicated style For all the biters, I'm shutting rappers up like Midas I got the force of a Turbo Porsche You get lost in the sauce and then thrown off course You can't destroy the decoys so detour! No sense of direction, so what'cha speed for? You wouldn't of never made it, how many styles have I created? So many rhymes I bust, ya frustrated, Then the mic will self sestruct, you'll get sprayed! Pass the hand grenade
Don't sweat the Technique Let's trace the hints and check the file Let see who bit to detect the style I flip the script so they can't get foul. At least not now, it'll take a while I change the pace to complete the beat I drop the bass, 'till mc's get weak. For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep. 'Cause when I speak, they freak To sweat the technique I made my debut in '86 Wit a melody and a president's mix And now I stay on target and refuse to miss And I still make hits wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps My underground sound vibrates the streets MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps When they sweat the technique Don't Sweat the Technique They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep. , but Researchers never found all the pieces yet Scientists try to solve the context Philosophers are wondering what's next Pieces are took to last who observe them They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them My ideas are only for the audience's ears For my opponents, it might take years Pencils and pens, are swords Letters put together form a key to chords I'm also a sculpture, born with structure Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the Difficult styles that'll be for the technology Complete sights and new heights after I get deep You don't have to speak just seek And peep the technique But don't sweat the technique I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap Then I get deep and the weak then complete their Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete They never grow old techniques become antiques Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant And the wild style'll have much more volume Classical too intelligent to be radical Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas It's cool when you freak to the beat But don't sweat the technique Don't sweat the technique

What's going on? What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man You invented a scam even you don't understand You rig the enigma, can't figure it out You change the route, now you're in doubt You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed, Figured you was all that but that ain't last; The times is harder, the drugs is heavier You say whatever, the more, the merrier; Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes, Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes; No more good times, no more time, Too far to find, you're almost blind, You can't see what spot that the trap is in. What's happening! You had it mapped out, your plans get torn, You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone You said you quit, stated your word is bond what's going on? What's going on? My neighborhood don't look so good I'll find a way out. yeah, I would if I could, But the government is doing a project. so I live in the projects; Where we fight for elbow room to the doom, Try to live long but you die too soon, I might not be alive to see 25, Taught at ten to make money and strive; I sold tapes at school and made some ends Met alot of skins and even made some friends, Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit, Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit; But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test, But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress! And then shake hands like a man, 'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand! But you had a one on one fight wit drugs, When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs, Clip after clip, until one of us is gone. what's going on? Yo, what's going on? The crime rate in New York State elevate, A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate, Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt, Kids on the playground shot down and kilt! Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more. 'Cause stray bullets explore! We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely, And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be Rubbed out in a quest for clout The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out! Half of the projects is dead or locked up, Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up. Human abortion create distortions. And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born. ! what's going on?
Casualties of War! Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade Where's the enemy? Who do I invade? Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips Cause I got a family that waits for my return To get back home is my main concern I'ma get back to New York in one piece but I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets Sky lights up like fireworks blind me Bullets, whistlin over my head remind me.

Day divides the night and night divides the day It's all hard work and no play More than combat, it's far beyond that Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall? Somebody give the President a call But I hear warfare scream through the air Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme Something like Monopoly: a government scheme Go to the Army, be all you can be Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me So I start letting off ammunition in every direction Allah is my only protection But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same and this is Asia, from where I came I'm on the wrong side, so change the target Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant? Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America Now it's mass hysteria I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor CASUALTIES OF WAR! The war is over, for now at least Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about Whole generation, left in doubt Innocent families killed in the midst It'll be more dead people after this So I'm glad to be alive and walkin Half of my platoon came home in coffins Except the general, buried in the Storm in bits and pieces no need to look for em I played it slick and got away with it Rigged it up so they would think they did it Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet when THEY call, I'm going AWOL Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war when I don't know who or what I'm fighting for So I wait for terrorists to attack Every time a truck backfires I fire back I look for shelter when a plane is over me Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G Kamikaze, strapped with bombs No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam Did I hear gunshots, or thunder? No time to wonder, somebody's going under Put on my fatigues and my camoflouge Take control, cause I'm in charge When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor CASUALTIES OF WAR!

When? Now? I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I am, I be, I am, I am, are you taping now? I am Shortie I am Patrick, I be the biggest shrimp collector in the world Gotta do that again I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I am Jack and I be fire I am Shortie I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I am mom and I be traveling I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I am Q-Tip, I be friction I am Tasha, I be black I am Shortie, I be 4'11" One more time I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I be Shortie and what? I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I be busy, I be happy, I be in love I am Asia, I be talking to Posdnous I am Shortie, I be 4'11" I am Posdnous I be the new generation of slaves Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes The pile of revenue I create But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late Product of a North Carolina cat Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie Who departed life just a little too soon And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame As we go a little somethin' like this Look, ma, no protection, now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough, so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay I am an early bird but the feathers are black, so the apples that I catch are usually all worms But it's a must to decipher one's queen from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ I cherish the twilight I maximize, my soul is the right size I watch for the power to run out on the moon And that'll be sometime soon Faker than a fist of kids speakin' that they're black when they're just niggas trying to be Greek Or some tongues who lied and said, "We'll be natives to the end, " nowadays we don't even speak I guess we got our own life to live, or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? Every now and then I step to the now, for now I see back then I might have acted like a fool Now, I won't apologize for it, this is not a bunch of Bradys, but a bunch of black man's pride Yet I can safely say, I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside I've always walked the right side of the road, if I wasn't making song, I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs But a man with a plan, and if I was a rug cleaner, bet you Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am The Plug Two brand with the flavor in the flute, watch the sniffin', so a sack of shows in demand I read the diction from the second page, I got the one-two gauge, baritone to the izm fan Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink, so let me need you to my ems go I push the infinite and carry it, my carrier's the three over one, so my plug-ins already know Lick shots with moo, catch the boo from a ghost in the heckling crowd if I give a foot Jack Ville caught a spill when a spill came from my mouth I brought a head down south I don't check for the noose and the neck, so I never tell my ems that finesse is knocking at my door I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun and dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore I bring the element H with the 2, so you owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade It's just mind over matter and what matters is that the mind isn't guided by the punished shade I keep the walking on the right side, but I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 'Cause that's how he wants to be, no difference, see, I wanna be like the name of this song I am I am Posdnous I be the new generation of slaves Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes The pile of revenue I create But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late The deeds of a natural are seeds that are no longer planted, so the famine in the mind is strong Tactics of another plane is now proven sane, sane enough to let you know from within this song I stabilize many cableized viewers, so my occupation's known, but not why I occupy And that is to bring the peace, not in the flower, but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am I am Kim and I be chilling the hell out I am Bob and I be really, really tired of doing this here, guys
I am Maceo. I be blowin' the soul out of this horn

Mase has rocked it on the console Scream real hard until you blow your tonsils Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles 'Cause you are now dancing to the new soul Live is the motion of the soul step Set the exposure to my one step This scene'll last to the next step All those in favor take a big step True to the Soul, we'll never back step In sense to that, we don't half step Just as a reminder from the last step Negative ones are lost in footsteps Levels we've set will never go down Competitions commence the step down Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down Can see that the Soul has got a new sound Dance until you find yourself a new part If you don't then I'll give you the True part When received you'll see the real small part Of the new way is no part at all Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace Movements always walking 'round now stressing peace When this biter should know true in peace Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef Still we are professing to be on a roll Public cause this party going on the road And if you crave sex, drugs and rock'n'roll Sent by the Quest, Jungle and De La Soul Give 'em a taste, Mase
Living in everyday is something Something everyday like this is our livin' Giving something sheer for the crowd is our major Major to the crowd is to hear what we're givin' No time to rest, we got work in the studio Studio suppliers rest at no time Showtime is enough when the Soul is performing Performing is the Soul y'all, and it's showtime Coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge Lounge with the homeboys how we are copin' Scoping new material for Paul to plug high-pitched High-pitched what Paul plugs in and still scopin' Bearer of peaceful views to express peace Peaceful expressions why we are bearers What the Soul tries to project is when existing in rap You're living in a full-time era Puttin' in spin the rhyme, rappers fear so Fear so much of what Pos is puttin' Couldn't do better, the punks they don't try hard Try hard enough, they don't, so they couldn't No joke to what I do inside this field This field to me is filed, there's no joke So soak up the fact there's no part-time Part-time rappers at, so soak Taking in new ideals leads to new groups New groups to better the Soul, I'm takin' Wakin' from days and nights to do my best So I'll keep on wakin' Wearer of a Plug logo to the dying Dying are rappers who think I'm no wearer What I'm trying to say is when dealing in rap You're living in a full-time era Love is to all, to all goes my love Dove comes to peace like stand comes to sit Stand for the court, 'cause standing is healthy Healthy in sense is mentally fit Pause for the poets of a new style of speak Just here to do the same with no trick Grab the Plug Two's live wire, my brother And find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict Ringo's the garbage I'm hearing Seek for the truth, my brother is tearing No time to back-step, 'cause if you back-step Look what you stepped in, you stepped in mess So look what's around you Don't worry for the Soul will find the truth About three years from now, you know why? 'Cause we're living in a full-time era
That's a fib—she had two twins, though and one crib Now she's only fourteen, what a start But this defect is ground common in these parts Now life in this world can be such a bitch And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch Negative's the attitude that runs the show When the stage is the G-H-E-T-T-O Which is the one to blame when bullets blow Either Peter, Jane, or John or Joe But Joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk And Peter's pimping Jane, and John's a punk Infested are the halls, also the brains Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown The kids are all alone 'Cause it's just the ghetto thang "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule This title is sought by the coolest fool Define coolest fool? Easy, the one who needs Attention in the largest span and loves to lead Always found at the jams, but never dance Just provoke violence due to one glance The future plays no matter, just the present flow When the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O Lies are pointed strong into your skull Deep within your brain against the wall To hide or just erase the glowing note Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat Truth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar Those who blame the G for all bizarre So open up your vents and record well 'Cause this is where we stand, for the true tell Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact They lie like ghettos form, 'cause people lack To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold The truth they never told 'Cause it's just the ghetto thang "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" Do people really wish when they blow Out the cake candles, and if so Is it for the sunken truth which could arise From out the characters in which the ghetto hides Roses in the ring supply their shown relief Granted it's planted by their shown belief Kill and feed off your own brother man Has quickly been adopted as the master plan Posses of our people has yet to provoke Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke What causes this defect, I don't know Maybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" Standing in the rain is nothing felt When problems hold more value, but never dealt With buildings crumbling to the ground Impact noise is solid sound But who's the one to say this life is wrong When ghetto life is chosen strong We seem to be misled about our dreams But dreams ain't what it seems When it's just the ghetto thang "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "It's just the ghetto thang" "Word" "Word"

Age and you're about to walk top-stage So wipe your Lottos on the mat Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your Involvements before the sun But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport And who's better for this than Plug One? Now don't worry about me squashin' other deals 'Cause they've already been squashed Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue Right behind the bush You'll stay with me, I know this But not because of all my Earthly treasures Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos But because I know I'll love you better May I cut this dance to introduce myself as The chosen one to speak? Let me lay my hand across yours And aim a kiss upon your cheek The name's Plug Two And from the soul I bring you The Daisy of your choice May it be filled with the pleasure principle In circumference to my voice About those other Jennies I reckoned with Lost them all like a homework excuse This time the Magic Number is two 'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce My destiny of love is brought to an apex Sex is a mere molecule In this world of love that I have for you It's true I know I'll love you better Now it's time to let this rhyme style Get somewhat poured in the mold Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul Life will begin at the cut of a rim Take it as filled to the rim as in brim Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup And spell Plug One's within Forward march is the say When transistors will play Come into bed is the mood Dolby sound will be then top crowned When I put the needle into your groove I got a good thing And in full swing I show this in gifts, words or letters But even without those three I know you'll be close to me 'cause I know I'll love you better It's I again, and the soul that I send Is taking steps to reach your heart Any moment you feel alone I can fill up your empty part We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten Then we can meet Mr. Stuckie And Pos' brother Lucky will preach "Let the wedding begin" Shot by an arrow of cupid Through the string of a G-clef My dear, I claim you're deaf And if you can hear me, by golly gee Trugoy is ready for what you possess We could live in my Plug Two home And on Mars where we could be all alone And we make a song for two Picture perfect things and I sing of how I know I'll love you better
Potholes in my lawn Everybody's sayin' What to do when suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin' They don't know that the Soul don't go for that Potholes in my lawn And that goes for my rhyme sheet Which I concentrated so hard on, see I don't ask for maximum security But my dwellin' is swellin' It nipped my bud when I happened to fall Into a spot Where no ink or an ink-blot Was on a scroll I just wrote me a new mot But now it's gone There's no Suckers knew that I hate To recognize that every time I'm writin' It's gone Potholes in my lawn I've found that it's not wise To leave my garden untended 'Cause eyes have now pardoned all laws of privacy Even paws are after my writer See, I've found that everyone's sayin' What to do when suckers are preyin' Upon my well-guarded spreadsheets Oh why, hell does it send up fleets Of evil-doers through the big hole To get to evil-doers who dig holes Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew I think I'd better plant traces to give clues Or better yet call 911 And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One Open a chair and let them realize the reason For concern of the Soul 'Cause we've come down with a case of potholes Potholes in my lawn Now you got the method What to do when you die The death that I predict in 'Plug Tunin' It's a shame that you deny to claim That you stole my words of fame That I wrote in my rhyme sheet Which I concentrated so hard on, see I don't ask for a barbed wire fence, B But my dwellin' is swellin' It nipped my bud when I happened to fall Into a spot Where no ink or an ink-blot Was on a scroll I just wrote me a new mot But now it's gone 'cause those Suckers knew that I hate To recognize that every time I'm writin' It's gone Potholes in my lawn Potholes in my lawn
Now let's get right on down to the skit A baby is brought into a world of pits And if it could've talked that soon in the delivery room It would've asked the nurse for a hit The reason for this? The mother is a jerk Excuse me, junkie which brought the work Of the old into a new life, what a way But this what a way has been a way of today Anyway push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead Consumers should erased it in the first wave 'Cause second wave from believers and believers Will walk to it then, even talk to it and say Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase. Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Nah, no my brother, no my sister Try to get hip to this Word, word to the mother I'll tell the truth so bear my witness Fly like birds of a feather, drugs are like pleather You don't wanna wear it No need to ask that question, just don't mention You know what the answer is Now I never fancied Nancy but the statement she made Held a plate of weight, I even stressed it to Wade Did he take any heed? Nah, the boy was hooked You could've phrased the word "Base" and the kid just shook In his fashion class once an A now an F The rock rules him now, the only designs left Were once clothes made for Oshkosh Has converted to nothing but stonewash Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun But don't hop in if you want to be down, son 'Cause that could mean down and out as an action What does it lead to? Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb People say what have I done for all my years My tears show my hard-earned work I heard shoving is worse than pushing But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher 'cause a pusher's a jerk Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more than charity But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity Is it a chant that slant the soul to feel for it? I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it Standing, scheming on a young one Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player Racked it all, tried to break, miscued Got beat by the boy in blue Next day you're out by the spot once more Looking hard for a crack in the hole I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff, word to the Dero The answer should have been no Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More Rewind that back This is the age for a new stage of fiend Watch how the zombies scream, "It's the crack! " Plain is plain it should explain it from the start Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart Now the base claims shop over every park Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Don't even think about it Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go Say no go

I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage What it was was more then plug-up dosage More than DAISY age Conversation drew a rule Which the crowd will roar by millions Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look For now the villains try to hold you underwater But one thing we all must heed Sony Walkmans keep us walking De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water' As I walked along my journey I thought, 'What have I just learned? ' In a flash I saw commotion There was movement in these ferns Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world? I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there? ' 'It's me, ' said Mr. Squirrel 'I've searched for you all over, now you're found No time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man We must find the P. A. Mase For my population's dying, and we're all in tune to doom Like your Daisy, I need water, I need chestnuts to consume. ' 'Mr. Squirrel, ' I said, 'I'm sorry But the problem can't be solved If there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved Always look to the positive and never drop your head For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread So let's tread water' Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up' Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish I looked down and then around and I heard 'Hi! I'm Mr Fish! How do you do? As for me I'm in tip-top shape today 'Cause my water's clean and no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do Though you're fed up, throw your head up With this advice from me to you And that's to tread water' As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard 'Psst, excuse me, Plug One. ' From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered 'Yes, are you talking to me? ' 'No alarm meant, ' he said, 'Let me introduce myself I'm Mr Monkey. ' 'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five Now how does your problem meet? ' He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all stand at three feet My swinging hand is bandaged up Could you help me with this chore? ' I brought him down to the Native shop And bought him copies of the De La score Which assisted well in his elevation Now all bananas is at his grasp He decided with this accomplished He would put me on to the path He told me to live by the Inner Sound, y'all Which would bring me health in showbiz Then to use them, not abuse them And then in the words that got me to 'em And that is to tread water

Three, that's the magic number Yes, it is, it's the magic number Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community Was born three: Mase, Dove and me And that's the magic number {What does it all mean? } Difficult preachin' is Posdnuos' pleasure Pleasure in preachin' starts in the heart Something that stimulates the music in a measure Measure in the music, breaks in three parts Casually see but don't do like the soul 'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys Doin' hip-hop hustle, no rock and roll Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky {Three} Parents let go, 'cause there's magic in the air Criticizing rap shows you're out of order Stop, look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set Fly rhymes are stored on a Da. I. S. Y production It stands for "Da Inner Sound, Y'all" and y'all can bet That the action's not a trick, but sure 'nough a function {What does it all mean? } Everybody wants to be a DJ Everybody wants to be an Em Cee But being speakers are the best And you don't have to guess De La Soul posse consists of three And that's the magic number This here piece of the pie Is not dessert, but the course that we dine And three out of every darn time The effect is "Mmm" when a daisy grows in your mind Showing true position, this here piece is Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' When that negative number fills up the casualty Maybe you can subtract it You can call it your lucky partner Maybe you can call it your adjective But odd as it may be Without my one and two where would there be My three? Mase, Pos and me And that's the magic number {What does it all mean? } Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds Common are speakers who honor the scroll Scrolls written daily creates a new sound Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em For now get 'em high off this dialect drug Time is a factor so it's time that counts Count not the negative actions of one Speakers of soul say it's time to shout Three forms the soul to a positive sum Dance to this fix and flex every muscle Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle Shake, rattle, roll to my magic number Now you may try to subtract it But it just won't go away Three times one? {One, two, three} And that's a magic number Yo, what's up? One, two, three No more no less, that's a magic number No more no less What it is No more no less Is this the future? Do the shang-a-lang Lord, tomboy tryna talk to me No more no less Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car? How high's the water, mama? How high's the water, mama? Three, that's a magic number

Take my number down It's 222-2222 I got an answering machine that can talk to you It goes Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through But leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you Yo, check it, exit the old style, enters the new But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a few Or should I say a flock 'cause around every block There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves and flaunt a nut that's doggy as a doe But it's not the mood to hear the tales of limousines and pails of money they'll make like a pro I be like, "Yo, black, just play me the tape" But at the show, the time to spare I just make But the songs created in they shacks be so wick-wick-whack, situations like this, I now hate They give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask, "Was it def? " And with the straightest face I be like, "Hell yes" I slip them the digits to papa Prince Paul So I don't go AWOL, but yet I know when they call, they get Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you? Hey, how are you doin'? Sorry you can't get through Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you? Check it out Party at the dug-out on Dixon Ave, haven't been to a jam in quite a while Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles 'stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles All I wanna do is cut on the deck crowd, but edition up here by the mile to the center Reliever of duty, Plug One moseys in and I be like, "Yo G, Pos does all the producing" Now woe is me to the third degree Mase pulls the funny, so I make like a bunny, jettin' But I'm getting used to this demo abuse Getting raped and giving birth to a tape 'Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker Attached to my success, sent like a stalker Make way to my radius playin' fly guy Try to get my back, they force like Luke Sky' Me, myself, and I go through this act daily and rarely do I not No matter how I dodge, some jackal always nails me, no matter what the plot And even out on tour they be like, "Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel" I be like, "Oh, swell" Unveil the numeric code that dials my room And tell them to call me at noon But of course there's no answering machine in my room But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour And if it rings while we're alone, she'll answer the phone And with the quickness, she'll recite like a poem "Hey, you done did the right thing, dialed up my ring ring Now you're waiting on the beep Say, I would love if you'd sing a tune to Tru instead of frontin' on the speak So no problemo, just play your demo, and at the end, it's break out time Please, oh, please, don't press rewind 'cause I'll just lay it down the line" Hey, how you doing? Sorry you can't get through Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you? Hey, how you doing?

Make the bass come out so clear This song does not contain explicit lyrics, but what it does contain is an undesired element. This element is known as the basehead: the lowest of lowest of all elements that exist. And the sad thing is this particular element. is me brudda! Brother, brother oh brother of mine We used to be down as partners in crime From our parents your name was forged I was the Beaver, you Curious George Wanted to dispose of this and that But curiosity had killed the cat At this age no wonder it was read But this was the fate that you were fed Throughout high school our minds we'd waste High off all the cheeba that we could taste Soon you had converted to nasal sports Every five minutes cocaine you'd snort Told me that you needed a stronger fix Stepped to the crack scene in '86 Unlike the other drugs where you had control This substance had engulfed your body and soul Now from me you lost dumb respect Said you need to put that shit in check Wanted me to believe that you had tried But your mind and the craving didn't coincide Said there was a voice inside you that talked That said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk Now the brother who could handle any drug Had just found the one that could pull his Plug Ya don't stop, ya don't, ya don't stop Ya don't stop, the body rock "Yo, bro, got another rock for your hiking boots" "Gonna make you scream and loop three loops" "Gonna take you far on a freeway, okay" Remember that day? Slipped me a smile for a 20 crack vial Guess what? Time to collect, correct Don't have a dime? It's payback time, payback time "Don't cry the blues 'cause I got bad news" "Should I stab ya? Should I bite ya? Should I use my tools? " No, I got another way to earn my defeat, ah! Slam the child on the hard concrete Make the bass come out so clear Brother, brother, stupid brother of mine Started getting high at the age of nine Now at twenty-one you're lower than low Nowhere to turn, nowhere to go My dividends and wares started to disappear Where it ended up, I had an idea Barking you with the quickness, reversed intent Instead went to Pop and gave him the print Now Pop grew tired of being a mouse Finally told you to get the hell outta the house From there a mother figure came into play Claimed for you she saw a better day Now Mom was a product of Christ's rebirth Thought the only chance was to go to church Quitting this stuff you had tried before This time you claimed you'd really score Something I had to see to believe Put on my suit and to church I weaved My, my, my. What happened to the people? The people who used to care about what took place in the world today? I've been summoned here today to reach the people who still can be reached, to save the people who still can be saved. Can I get an "Amen? Can I get an Amen"? Hit me! Forgive us. Said it's taking over. Taking over the world. All it's doing is taking over. Where them crackers at? Them crackers that they serve. Where they at? Said evil's taking over Said evil's taking over Said evil's taking over, evil's taking over The Lord's gonna forgive us, the Lord's gonna forgive us, Lord Said the Lord's gonna forgive us The Lord's gonna forgive us Bullshit, didn't believe a lick Knew this fool too well for that to stick Instead I gave you benefit of the doubt Wanted to see if you would work it out First you reach your front of calm Walked 'round by rehearsing psalms Then you smiled with the funky frown What do you know, the voice is back in town Mom would say it would soon go away You and I knew it was here to stay But the man helped you when you helped yourself That meant going to rehab for your health Finally it went and blew your cork Heard you moved to the comfortable streets of New York And when my friends see me and come and ask "Yo, where's your brother at? " I'll be the first to splash: "Yo, he's a basehead" - Yo know who that was? - No - The guy from De La Soul. Pos. Posdnuos - Who? - You heard of De La Soul, right? - Right - Well he was the one from De La Soul - The one with the real nappy hair - The one with. the dark-skinned one - With the glasses? - Yeah - Ugh, the ugly one!

Ah! What a beautiful day in the concrete jungle. I think I'll go down to Calliope and just be a fucking dickhead! Damn, I feel good today. I look forward to going in and just beating the shit out of somebody and taking their money. What a fucking great job I have I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music? Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that I just hate everybody. Damn it, it has to be that Life is grand, life is great. I need myself a real cheap date. Some woman I can take to McDonald's, spend a dollar twenty-five on and have, like, the best time of your life with afterwards. Life is too good to believe sometimes. But we all can't have it the way I do. So to all you suckers out there, kiss off. All right? Bye bye

The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya It means I find my mind can excel to a greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught in relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine with a sense of confidence Accomplishments, are achieved off lots of gifts But slopiness, I could never tolerate it Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited While other groups have faded, just like haircuts We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain to expose every vain Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame You've got no beats, so you get no seats at this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable Kane and Able, jealous brothers And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track It means that nothing can be wack The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power Not withstood by any mortal or immortal To make you get on the floor til another dope jam we slam with precision Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism or reflections, through a spectrum And all the soft silly suckers I'ma wet them in other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame. This is the meaning of the name "what does it all mean? " GangStarr, it means a lot to me It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically Gang represents my boys or a posse So just back up off me And the Starr symbolizes the power Making the suckers and weak brothers cower We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense Crazy offense, and stupid defense Now, have I made myself clear? Or do I have to call on DJ Premier? For he and I make up the songs that you long for Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door Waiting for a call or for the doors to open Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen But to be chosen is a divine gift You better get a job quick See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak You oughta take a peak and check out the technique Seek, and you shall find GangStarr stands for mastermind Simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame. This is the meaning of the name "what does it all mean? "

You can't tell me life was meant to be like this a black man in a world dominated by whiteness Ever since the declaration of independence we've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence It goes: all men are created equal that's why corrupt governments kill innocent people With chemical warfare they created crack and AIDS got the public thinking these were things that black folks made And every time there's violence shown in the media usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice TV and the news for years they have fed you this foolish notion that blacks are all criminals violent, low lifes, and then even animals I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me but I must do my part to combat the conspiracy The S. A. T. is not geared for the lower class so why waste time even trying to pass The educational system presumes you to fail the next place is the corner then after that jail You've got to understand that this has all been conspired to put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired It even exists when you go to your church cuz up on the wall a white Jesus lurks They use your subconscious to control your will they've done it for a while and developed the skill to make you want to kill your own brother man black against black you see it's part of their plan They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap what they really want to do is get rid of us blacks Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me you must be aware to combat the conspiracy Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold now that rap is big business the snakes got bold They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop cuz they have no regard for real hip-hop They'll compare you to others and say: "but yo, he sells" and you know in your heart that he's weak as hell So you say: "I ain't doing that corny stuff" but they tell ya that your chart positions will go up Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises and when they break 'em then your mama says "Son you're making records but that guy seems shady" it could be too late and your career could be played gee I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see we all have a job to combat the conspiracy

Yo Ren ! Whassup ? Take Yo Ruthless, plenty of that and much more So at the party, Ren is controllin the floor that you step and do your danceroutine It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene with a villain doin damage on a 24 track With confusion to finish my conclusion Arhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back Cold killin You wanna know what it's means ? With the stupid dope rhyme So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin and a look that keeps you all starin and wondering why I'm invincible But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible I don't take no shorts while I'm constructin the ground that makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound Girls drool on me like a dyin I go to the party. I hip a hop the spot I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot aspirin like they're on fire and their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin And for this reason I'm a walkin threath So when I'm on stage I want. Quiet on tha set N. W. A. take Now to get started with my musical profession A gangsta or villain in mine is in session The way that I'm referrin to this makes ya move ya butt but don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up Anyway I keep the clappin along coz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong who could ask for anything more when N. W. A. is cold rockin the floor like stupid, actin like a retard waitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part It tips me so with temptation writin my lyrics with this hyped information Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines It's mine ! Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed It's irresistable, meanin that you can't avoid And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat but after I rip it up I want. Quiet on tha set N. W. A. take I can be loud as hell, think I will ? Yeah I like that better I think I earn respect And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect coz if it ain't ruff it ain't me So who really cares how you want me to be See, I'm just me standin at the top of the pile and doin soft known tunes it ain't my style And this concludes our program of how N. W. A. makes a ruthless jam Now first we take an average drum Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb It's no secret, that I sit alone at night Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write all kinda lyrics that's promised to play to make everybody say: (They can be cold and ruthless no question about that, but sometimes it's more complicated. ) Yo Dre Bring that beat back, bring that beat back Now MC Ren is here workin like super glue No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin o' you Coz I'm the pusher, supplyin the fix And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix But I'm makin obstacles of enemy traps to catch any MC's with the weak-ass raps Crucifyin their like just for usin my name The definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game If they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time coz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme So, you're in the back of me just listen and learn because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn Now my sideman wants to give a preview so at my next concert I wanna see you there not sittin in a chair standin on yo feet, with yo hand in the air Now I'm about to get out but I'll be back But next time expect the more funkier track deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion with lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion The beat that I'm and you know that's bad Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set
How short's your hair right now? Look, I'ma tell you like this I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt See I'm from the street, so I know what's up On these silly games that's played by the women I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em But you know, I'm a menace to society But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me So I step to em, with aggression Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today See they think we narrow minded Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded So I walk over and say "How ya doin? " See I'm only down for screwin, but you know ya gotta play it off cool Cause if they catch you slippin, you'll get schooled And they'll get you for your money, son Next thing you know you're gettin their hair and they nails done Fool, and they'll let you show em off But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough Or a headache, it's all give and no take Run out of money, and watch your heart break They'll drop you like a bad habit cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it Messin with me though, they gets none You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one (Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin for me but get out of my face. ) (I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin right jumpin off unless he got dollars) Sometimes I used to wonder How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number He's gettin juiced for his ducats I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket And won't think nuttin of it She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me You know I spell girl with a B A brother like me is only out for one thing I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing You want lobster huh? I'm thinking Burger King And when I take you, you get frustrated You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it But you see, I don't go nuts Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts It start comin out the pocket, to knock it But when the damage is done. You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl For the simple fact that, I ain't the one (I don't care how they look if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin none. ) (Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some, play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money. ) Give you money why bother Cause you know I'm lookin nothin like your father Girl, I can't be played or ganked Ganked means getting took for your bank Or your gold or your money or something Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing They get mad when I put it in perspective But let's see if my knowledge is effective To the brothas man they robbing you blind Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind Keep your money to yourself homie and if you got enough game You'll get her name and her number Without going under You can't leave em and love and stay above em I used to get no play now she stay behind me Cause I said I had a Benz 190 But I lied and played the one Just to get some now she feels dumb To my homies it's funny But that's what you get trying to play me for my money Now don't you feel used But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots You shouldn't be, so damn material And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal Now how many times do I have to say it Cause if I have to go get a gun You girls will learn I don't burn You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one I don't see no rings on this finger Yeah you love my money, I got what I wanted - beat it
Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage So whenever I'm steppin' cover your head like an ostrich Groupies been waitin' for this, suckers been hatin for this You know why? Because so many are relatin' to this Jealous is how they feel it intentionally But they start to love it because I made it eventually Pumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin' Cause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin' Yo, you know the color, the villain's in black Always down to make noise, and attack So you better get back unless you wanna come with it And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it You're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin' You're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and I'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts That's how it is when N. W. A. starts to jack So brothers that wanna scrap with me That sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me Especially beggin' to write some lyrics with me I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me Cause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison And if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin' But I understand cause you're mentally slow Cause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go If it ain't' ruff, it ain't me If it ain't ruff, it ain't me Lemme bust a freestyle there I can tell that you're afraid to fight me Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me Because your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat I'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck And clean the dirt off your face that causes acne It's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me This is the round where the punch will go Into your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin Like, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin' Scared to speak with a thought when they're chosen The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen This is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol' Against a brother on a tip, with a Kangol Givin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin But I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin' With the hype of a nine volt battery And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good Meanin' I'mma flow I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go If it ain't ruff, it ain't me If it ain't ruff, it ain't me Get funky The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect While I'm thinkin of a fool to select To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim Slammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them Tell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer And get a new track o' drums so I can play with Percussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform Yo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by Hey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I For fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear The Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super But now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper But a soldier with a top rankin Givin' dope material, the hell with the gankin' So play like an airplane and just jet And keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, if not I'm afraid of the show That you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go If it ain't ruff, it ain't me If it ain't ruff, it ain't me If it ain't, if it ain't

They like it stylistic And I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic C-C-C-cameras are flashin, when I'm in action A photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion Pure simplicity, see it's elementary You hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century Try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys Parental discretion is advised Ren is most extremely high performance The black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous Some shit I don't take it, not even in a toliet And shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it Turn up the pilot as it burns And maybe, the motherfuckers will learn I'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible Not considered a prince, cause I'm a principal I'm engineerin; the shit that you're hearin Cause when it comes to power, I'm power steerin Silly you say, I say you're silly when you say it Rushin to the eject, to put my shit in and play it It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur And I'm not givin a fuck, while I'm damagin ya It's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it And if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it Possession is mine and I'm the holder Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older So for you to step off would be wise And say fuck it, parental discretion is advised I be what is known as a bandit You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it Cause if you fail to see, read it in braile It'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex of a genius, my rapid-stutter-steppin if you seen this dope, you hope that I don't really mean this But if played, made the grade or high-top fade It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark You guess it was a test of a different style It's just another motherfucker on the pile Drivin your ass with the flow of your tongue You hung yourself short, the after-knowledge was brung to your attention, by the hardest motherfuckin artist that is know for lynchin any sucker in a minute Stagger 'em all When I start flowin like Niagara Falls Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle Move like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle I get low on the flow so let your kids know When I bust, parental discretion is a must Little did they know, that I would be arrivin And it's surprisin, rockin it from where I been But it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made in the trade where funky ass records are bein played Fuck the regular, yo as I get better the bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick So I get 'em hot, thinkin they're gonna get it As they sit, rubbin their legs like a cricket To you it may be funny, but there's no service of beef, without money So slip the C-note, and you can choke on a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat Foreplay; to me ain't shit When you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick of the Eaze, if you can deal with the size But if you can't, parental discretion's advised! Shut the fuck up!
Yo, man. There's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetrating But scared to kick reality. Man, you've been doing all this dope producing. You had a chance to show 'em what time it is. So, what you want me to do? Express yourself. I'm expressin' with my full capabilities, And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities, 'Cause some don't agree with how I do this. I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist I'm droppin' flava, my behaviour is hereditary, But my technique is very necessary. Blame it on Ice Cube. Because he says it gets funky When you got a subject and a predicate. Add it on a dope beat And that'll make you think. Some suckers just tickle me pink To my stomach. 'Cause they don't flow like this one. You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one Or two before I'm through. So don't try to sing this! Some drop science While I'm droppin' English. Even if Yella Makes it a-capella I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or a sess. 'Cause its known to give a brother brain damage. And brain damage on the mic don't manage Nothin' But makin' a sucker and you equal. Don't be another sequel. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Now, gettin' back to the PG. That's program, and it's easy. Dre is back. Newjacks, I mean hollow, Expressin' ain't their subject Because they like to follow The words, the style, the trend, The records I spin. Again and again and again Yo, you on the other end. Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes with no help. There's no fessin' and guessing While I'm expressing myself. It's crazy to see people be What society wants them to be. But not me! Ruthless. Is the way to go They know. Others say rhymes that fail To be original. Or they kill where the hip-hop starts, Forget about the ghetto And rap for the pop charts. Some musicians curse at home But scared to use profanity When up on the microphone. Yeah, they want reality. But you won't hear none. They rather exaggerate, a little fiction. Some say no to drugs and take a stand, But after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman. Or they ban my group from the radio. Hear NWA and say "Hell no! ". But you know it ain't all about wealth. As long as you make a note to. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Express yourself. From the heart. 'Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart Then expression is a big part of it. You ain't efficient when you flow You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise. Full of rigor mortis. There's a little bit more to show I got rhymes in my mind, and better like an embryo. Or a lesson - all of 'em expression And if you start fessin' - I got a Smith and Wessun For you. I might ignore your record Because it has no bottom. I get loose in the summer. When in spring and autumn It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical. Doin' the job NWA is the lynch mob! Yes, I'm a cob? But you know you need this. And the knowledge is growin' Just like a fetus, or a tumor. But here's the rumor: Dre is in the neighborhood And he's up to no good. When I start expressin' myself, Yella, slam it! 'Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage. Or I'm a be too hyped, And need a straight jacket. I got knowledge and other suckers lack it. So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic, Ask what it's like. It's like we gettin' hype tonight. 'Cause if I strike It ain't for your good health. But I won't strike if you just. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Express yourself. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Express yourself. Come on and do it. Come on and do it. Come on and do it. Come on and do it.
Right about now, N. W. A. court is in full effect Judge Dre presiding In the case of N. W. A. vs. the Police Department; prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy-motherfucking-E Order, order, order Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help your black ass? You goddamn right! Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? Fuck the police coming straight from the underground A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown And not the other color so police think they have the authority to kill a minority Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun to be beating on, and thrown in jail We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell Fucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager with a little bit of gold and a pager Searching my car, looking for the product Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics You'd rather see, me in the pen than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o Beat a police out of shape and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape To tape off the scene of the slaughter Still getting swoll off bread and water I don't know if they fags or what Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none But don't let it be a black and a white one 'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top Black police showing out for the white cop Ice Cube will swarm on any motherfucker in a blue uniform Just 'cause I'm from, the CPT Punk police are afraid of me! HUH, a young nigga on the warpath And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath of cops, dying in L. A. Yo Dre, I got something to say Fuck the police Example of scene one Pull your goddamn ass over right now Aww shit, now what the fuck you pulling me over for? 'Cause I feel like it! Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up Man, fuck this shit Aight smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail! MC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked-up incident? Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority because the niggas on the street is a majority A gang is with whoever I'm stepping and the motherfucking weapon is kept in a stash box for the so-called law Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw Lights start flashing behind me But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me But that shit don't work, I just laugh because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you punk! " Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk Pulling out a silly club, so you stand with a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so you can see what's up And we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up! Make you think I'mma kick your ass but drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime But I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me or any asshole that threatens me I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me The motherfucking villain that's mad With potential to get bad as fuck So I'mma turn it around Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound Yeah, something like that but it all depends on the size of the gat Taking out a police, would make my day But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say Fuck the police Yeah man, what you need? Police, open now Aww shit We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em What the fuck did I do, man what did I do? Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor But I didn't do shit Man just shut the fuck up! Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast on a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger of an Uzi or an AK 'Cause the police always got something stupid to say They put out my picture with silence 'Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot by me or another nigga And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger And as you all know, E's here to rule Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a dumb motherfucker with a gun And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one that I take out, and then get away While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say Fuck the police The verdict The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chickenshit motherfucker Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie! Get him out of here! I want justice! Get him the fuck out my face! I want justice! Out, right now! Fuck you, you black motherfuckers! Fuck the police!

And say that I'm no good But I can't find jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out Gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out When the cops came, they gave a fake name Because the life in the streets is just a head game So therefore, to make more A fifteen year old black kid will go and rob a liquor store And get shot in the process He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest Why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me? I guess it's the way shit has to be Back when I was young getting a job was murder Fuck flipping burgers 'Cause a deserve a nine-to-five I can be proud of That I can speak loud of And to help a nigga get out of.

" The appetite is tremendous So I'm gonna spin this Try for some violence because they ask me to end this Some trouble that I caught 'cause I was noisy A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze He took a swing for my head Thought I was faded Start runnin' for the door But the fucker never made it The sound of the 9 went bang And all over the wall was his motherfuckin' brain 'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on So set the alarm, 'cause I hit like a motherfuckin' bomb I do damage with the 9 in my hand But the average nigga That don't know me don't understand I'm from the streets so therefore You know I don't care for A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas The niggas the niggas yo And that's the way this shit gotta go, and even so But any time that the 9 wanna leave I got a . 38 hidden up the sleeve And it's ready to go to war 'Cause that's what it's here for I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more And that's a million and one They couldn't hang with the appetite 'Cause they wasn't rappin' right So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence For fuckin' up the essence appetite for destruction "Cops put a hurting on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you. 'Oh come on, those beatings, those people resistin' arrest. '" Check it out yo, in the house yo So I can show and flow and let the people know So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton But first let me tell you somethin' I possess the 10 commandments of the hip-hop thugster, Known as the thief and murderer: First one Honor thy nigga with an attitude Gotta get respect or break your motherfuckin' neck Second one Allways gotta fuck outta wedlock I like it when the pussy goes snap, crackle and pop Number three I'm a gangster, fanatic I smoke any fool tryna cause some static Number four Here's what's in store A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore Fifth one My killing's just begun I pull out my gun now they keep me on the run Step six Hmmm, it's kinda tricky Can't forget that I'm motherfuckin' chicken-shit To the ones who tries to play the E By the time you get to seven you'll be 6 feet deep Number eight Make no mistake, Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey Ninth one I gotta be raw, Fuck any brain-washing man-made law Last but not least, I must be real Number ten is my appetite to kill We're interrupting the motherfucking programme to bring you special public service announcement.

Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute The bitch was cute, so now I had to excecute And shoot game like a real nigga With a still trigga Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga I think I had a flashback though 'Cause I said "fuck it" Loped and Choked and Smoked to the ho' like this : "Bitch, it's all about Dre The money money money and this all I gotta say" Of course she came with me And remained with me 'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be Workin' that trick shit 'Cause niggaz knew that she was someone A little later though she called 1 In the chest and I knew that it was commin' By who and how the all act would be done? So what? One less bitch you gotta worry about But that ain't how it turned out. Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her Straight to the Muthafuckin' trigger and said "I got her!

One less, One less, One less bitch you gotta worry about! . MIX with Easy E sayin' : In reality - A fool is one who believes that all women are ladies A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches, And all bitches are created equal. To me - all bitches are the same : Money hungry scandlist groopy ho's that's always riding on a nigga's dick. Always in a nigga's pocket and when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind. To me : ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT! One less, One less, One less bitch you gotta worry about! One less, One less, One less bitch you gotta worry about!
What we gonna do right here is go back. Now this is some shit that's from the Dayz of Wayback, When niggas in Compton first started to jack. When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drug, So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged. They always loved that shit. They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks. But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's. But in the Dayz of Wayback I couldn't be laid back, Because I needed ends and I made that. I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and Start robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians. Anything it took to get paid. A nigga like Ren already had the plane made. And I was in it to win it and not to lose. And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse. And police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em. But not with no money - Yo, I was frayin'em. And never get caught because nobody is snitch, But one hoe did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch! Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and 'Cause everybody knows who's the bossin': That black nigga that they call Ren. You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10. So listen to me as I reminisce the Dayz of Wayback. So check it out y'all. It was once a time in the Dayz of Wayback When niggas was gettin' jacked. In fact it was one I used to pass through up, And kickin' ass through up. Muthafuckin' Compton Massacre. Now let me tell you a little something about Compton When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in. Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm. Now it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam. Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin', Niggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'. With so many ways to come up The average nigga didn't give a fuck About another muthafucka in this game and Claimin' what he claimin', Livin' like he livin', Killin' after killin'. Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man Was the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran. But now your best friend is your worst friend. Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'. So now your shit is stolen And you and your niggas start rollin'. Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of. Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder. They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang, Or a black thang Or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang. But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan A nigga brung up and strung up. Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me? Rememberin' the days that's past me. Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest. The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test. And number one way for you to pass, Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass. They never in the wrong though, So I made a song so Muthafuckas had know If, yo, livin situations make you wanna get a gat. That's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback.
The motherfucking saga continues. All of you who don't believe in the real gangsta shit, cause when it comes to the real niggaz, it makes the shit they're much harder to deal with. Yeah, above the laws in this motherfucker, like Mafia for life, down with the real niggaz 4 life. Ha-ha, yo sweet-talk, tell 'em what the fuck we're here for. Well I write ya, USE, Compton, Watts, The Wood, all across the motherfucking USA. They know I'm walking through the valley of real niggaz, I should fear no man on the motherfucking planet, hit me one. Cause I've been to the mountain top y'all, and I have been seeing through the eyes of a real nigga. Yo, what you think about the real niggaz 187? Yo, they make some of the coooooolest shit I had never heard, Yo, when we came, G, I almost gave it up, to the ruthless motherfucking gangstas. Fear no man. . because you're shit man yourself, time to put the world at yourself man. Me not seeing bobba-clot mobbing to see a pussy-clot run, bob-bob-bob-bob-bob, keep Babylon on the run, see. The real niggaz is back, cause there's to many bullshit records out, niggaz beat it for what we put out. But you don't have to wait no longer, because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger. So many groups made three albums or more, and their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store. They wonder why it never sold, niggaz rapping since the seventies and still never went gold. Our first record sold two million copies, that's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy. You came out the streets and crossed over, and after that your career is fucking over. Because after that you're not around, so shut the fuck up, and witness the sound of some real niggaz. Yeah, motherfucker. keeping all you busters on the run in ninety-one, kick that shit Ren. Most niggaz can't understand, and never will if they ain't part of the ruthless Mafia-clan. Niggaz is dedicated to the streets, with hyped fucking lyrics and a dope ass beat. The songs will never come soft, because I come off, so don't get in my way or motherfucker you'll be cut off. And it's something you can move your lips to, to wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you. And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K, all day that's with no play. Cause ain't no rap group out, that I know, that makes me wanna listen to the radio. All I hear is motherfuckers trying to make a comeback with lovesongs, and that shit is whack. And that's why your ass ain't around, cause you don't have the motherfucking sound of a real nigga.

What you want is an unexpected approach, that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence, until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted. Approach to danger, don't move; it's hard to predict what will happen next. drop the gun you could've prevented a tragedy. You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking, a self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking. This is a tribulation, the weakened judge, the prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge. I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme, they're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream. One vision was of life, the other was death, Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath. So you burn in my pit that I call hell, where you got send because your shit don't sell. My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke, of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke. I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em, do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em. And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger, but fuck it, they can approach to the danger. If you can be seen, you can be hit. If you can be hit, you can be killed. Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler, outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger. Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be, a dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody. With everybody thinking of death I kept working, to be one of the last niggaz left. So many people looking for hope, they're broke, without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat. A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me, so figuring to see the D-E-A-D bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary, so it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing, but they better take caution, before Dre goes off, and starts killing motherfuckers, just in order to change the anger for the real nigga, when I approach to danger Approach the motherfucking danger, Come back to hell and send me some time. Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner, another dead body and you wanna keep running. But even the rain turns black, all you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light. No prison, nobody makes bail, everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail. Think about death, taking your last breath, heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left. For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine, even though they wanna make a crime. Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning, because it will release the fucking police. Fuck 'em, I approach to danger, cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up. So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye, cause in the long run.

" She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistible I couldn't pay the bitch to quit 'cause the ho' was doin' some ol' crazy shit That made me start havin' a fit' 'cause the bitch sucked a hellified dick suck this dick It's the world's biggest dick Don't matter just don't bite it It's the world's biggest dick Don't matter just don't bite it Don't matter just don't bite it Get it all baby! Now one night I was at a drive-in And a car full of niggas straight drove in I thought they was commin' to start trouble but no Five niggas in the back it was the neighborhood ho' Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy Thirty minutes later and the windows all were foggy And I'm off in my car havin' a fit 'cause the bitch that I'm with Said no fuckin' on the first date, shit And I'm like, "Damn! I wish I was in the bucket To be the sixth nigga with the ho' and I can fuck it. " So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar And got the fuck out the car Went to the bucket and I looked through the window It was some niggas that I knew they let me in yo And my turn was like next I couldn't see her face, all I saw was the pussy and her chest I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughtta Peep over the seat.

Now I'm a break it down with a fact Since the last "Just don't bite it" girls don't know how to act Sayin' that they never would suck a dick But when they've tried it they couldn't quit 'cause ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit And those are the main ones that say they don't do it But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it So fellows, next time they try to tell a lie That they never suck a dick, punch the bitch in the eye And then the ho' will fall to the ground Then you'll open up her mouth Put your dick in and move the shit around And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone And then she won't let go Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe Then the stupid bitch is out doing the same shit the next night Because she just can't quit 'cause she's addicted, addicted, she's addicted, addicted She's addicted to suck a good dick "It's the world's biggest dick" Don't matter just don't bite it "It's the world's biggest dick" Don't matter just don't bite it Don't matter just don't bite it Get it all baby!

Another homie got murdered on a shakedown And his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown Two shots hit him in the face when they blasted A framed picture and a closed casket A single file line about 50 cars long All drivin' slow with they lights on He got a lot of flowers and a big wreath What good is that when you're six feet deep? I look at that shit and gotta think to myself And thank God for my health 'Cause nobody really ever know When it's gonna be they family on the front row So I take everything slow, go with the flow And shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know 'Cause that's what Pops told me But I wish he could have said it. to my dead homiez I remember we painted our names on the wall for fun Now it's "Rest in Peace" after every one Except me, but I ain't the one to front Seems like I'm viewin' a body after every month Plus, I knew him when he was yea big Pour beer on the curb before I take a swig But somethin' ain't right When it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight Lovin' each other in a caring mood There's lots of people and lots of food They say "Be Strong" and you're tryin' But how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'? So that's why Ice Cube's dressed up Because the city is so fuckin' messed up And everybody is so phony Take a little time. to think about your dead homiez.

" It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot She said "Fuck em, cause they get sparked alot" I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable And then I put my Nikes on the coffee table Her brother came in, he's into gangbangin Cause he walked up and said "What set you claimin? " I don't bang I write the good rhymes The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up He threw up a set and then he was gone I'm thinkin to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt She said please excuse my house and all that I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact Lookin at a fucked up black and white Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right She had another brother that was three years old And had a bad case of the runny nose He asked me who I was then I had to pause It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked Only thirteen and already pregnant I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids They was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin' And tellin' and look at this young punk bailin' I heard a knock on the door without the password And her mom's got the 12 guage Mossberg The nigga said "yo, what's for sale" And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo She made the drop and got the 20 dollars From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar The girl I was waiting for came out I said "Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house" I got my coat and suddenly . The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome And I said to myself once again it's on He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up I said FUCK how much abuse can a nigga take Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case He said "Get out my face" and musta had a grudge His reply, "Tell that bullshit to the judge" The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin' I said "Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'" She started draggin and all of a sudden We all got tossed in the paddy wagon Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint Now the story you heard has one little object: Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects

You are appreciated When I was young, me and my mama had beef 17 years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school And scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady, place no one above ya Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 'Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate You just working with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady, place no one above ya Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Pour out some liquor and I reminisce 'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated Lady, don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady, place no one above ya Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? Sweet lady Lady Lady Lady

Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears. Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons trying to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come Lord! , I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears. God! I lost so many peers And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears. I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears. Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears. God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

I'm striving to save my soul I stay cold drinking a forty bottle I'm so sorry I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby! Moms had to entertain many men Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again I'm getting a bit older and I'm starting to be a bother Moms can't stand me cause I'm looking like my father Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities Instead of taking care of me, he'd rather live lavishly That's why I'll never be a father Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles Said I was an only child Look at mama's lonely smile! It's hard for a son to see his mother cry She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys I'm so sorry I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby! Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show And oh I guess ya didn't know That I would grow to be so strong Looking kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong? Where was the money that you said, you would send me Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly Ask about school and my welfare But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares You think I'm blind but this time I see you coming, Jack! You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no running back Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart So don't even start with that "Born to be a father" shit Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me You're so sorry I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby! I never meant to leave but I was wanted Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger If I wanted to to keep you breathing, had to be out of range-a Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to Maybe it's my fault for being a father living fast But living slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong It took a little longer than I thought I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts Now I'm doing time and I wish you'd understand All I ever wanted was for you to be a man Grow to be the titan you was meant to be Keep the war fighting by the writings that you sent to me I'm so sorry I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time For all this time I'm so sorry For all this time For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby! I'm so sorry I'm so sorry

In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli". Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac—excuse me–Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P. I. G. , and several other New York rappers. Jay Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac–rather Makaveli–was not available for comment, but released this statement: It's not about East or West It's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks – which side are you on? These niggas is still fucking talking? You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches Punk motherfuckers, this is it Killuminati Style Solo Shit, Bring it!

Killing us one by one In one way or another America will find a way to eliminate the problem One by one The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's And one by one We are being wiped off the face of this earth At an extremely alarming rate And even more alarming is the fact That we are not fighting back Brothers, sisters, niggas When I say "nigga" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga Niggas, what are we going to do? Walk blind into a line or fight Fight and die if we must die, like niggas This is for the masses, the lower classes The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living But we were kept out Made to feel inferior, but we're superior Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honour a man that refuses to respect us Emancipation Proclamation? Please! Lincoln just said that to save the nation These are lies that we all accepted Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it Running through our community, killing the unity The war on drugs is a war on you and me And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin' But it's wrong to keep someone from learning something So get up, it's time to start nation building I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children That they can be all that they want to be There's much more to life than just poverty This is definitely uh. words of wisdom AMERICA!

What can I say but watch your back, youngster, As I sit and wonder, my other brother's steadily goin' under. It's like a curse, and it hurts 'cause it's worse, Momma's crazy 'cause her baby's in a herse. Wussup wit' the love?

It was a Saturday night on the streets of California Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock Hit three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot Now my beeper started beepin, I threw that shit in the sink I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Prince See, I was quittin the game and tonight was my fling You see, on the streets they're players but only one king Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast You gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin in his brand new Benz I had many adversaries but very few close friends We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass High-signin was his trademark and he did it with class Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air I spied my man Jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks "Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak? " Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun "Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man 'member when your boys took that fall? And I posted the bail cause yo ass was locked up" Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore Hoes grabbed for they niggaz when D hit the set Cause what Donald-D wanted is what Donald-D'd get Donald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place "Yo Ice, you the coolest and Evil, you mean But I got the fliest new shit rollin off gasoline" Everyone in the party moved quickly outside To see Donald-D's ultimate Superfly ride It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche A Testarossa Ferrari - convertable of course It purred like a jet, "Yo man, I bought it with cash" It had 'Donald-D' written in gold on the dash Then out of nowhere came a shot across the street I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak There was blood on my hands and I fell to the ground And all I could hear was, "Yo, Ice is down! " Somebody had shot me that night that I quit The night that I ended all this hustlin playin shit It's ironic ain't it, the night I retired Would be the same night that my whole life expired
A child was born in the East one day Moved to the West coast after his parents passed away Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats In poetry he was considered elite Became a young gangster in the streets of L. A. Lost connections with his true roots far away But no matter the job or crime He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme New York's hip hop movement broke loose DJ's cut records, raps had the juice Since busting rhymes was his natural thing He was crowned the west coast MC king But after his inauguration there was a rush Of wack rappers with one intention to crush This master rapper and take his throne A simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone Assassins came in groups of one through five With raps no mortal MC could survive But he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty Battling from Friday on through to Thursday Never losin', about never ending in doubt Every confrontation K. O. knock out On his never ending journey to the T. O. P. The L. A. player M. C. Ice-T

Ice-T back in that ass Return of the real Muthafuckas fakin and frontin like they don't know what time it is Niggas on the streets ain't really got a muthafuckin choice Muthafucka Born hustler I only run with real niggas who wear gold and jewels Diamond rings, strapped with tools I take no shorts cause I been in it for the long one, the strong one Gotta tell the truth, yo, half my niggas is on the run Street giant defiant to the laws That the white man made, nigga That's why we play, nigga A/k/a the street hustler from the Westside Too damn fly, too much finesse for the hoo ride I rather take a mark off smooth Cause the skilll of a hustler is to stick and move And make you say: "Damn, what's his name? Got to give a nigga props cause the kid got game" Mad game, fool, I base my hustle not on strength But think, you say 'the liqor store', I say 'brinks' Cause my mind's on the massive roll of the dice The magnitude of my game's insane, precise So now you're mad cause I got money and you don't The hustlers win, the busters won't What can I say, you can't come out and play With the real ones, dig this You'll get broke with the quickness I don't gamble, I cheat when it's on Two g's on the table, two in my palm And if I spill up, I pull the nickel . 25 strap Then the place gets flat and then I'm out the back With my niggas and them 4's on thangs And if I really wanna floss I flex my Bentley wings Damn, over your head, got a problem Keepin lyrics down to earth so normal niggas can solve em But the game's extreme so quit your high beams And increase the light, now can you see me, you might If you ever been to jail or shot, sold rocks I'm talkin 'bout weight down like movin ki's and pounds But every nigga in the hood ain't fly Light-skinned or dark, they're 90% marks Straight vics and they got money to give Then without em tell, me how the hell a hustler lives. I got no love for a lame I use my strategy from crack to rap, no shame And now instead of cooking some ki's I'm flippin million dollar call em wack MC's But suckers got it twisted, they missed it Wastin they life when yo, they mentally gifted The streets ain't the only fuckin hustle in town You gotta get in where you fit in, gotta stay way down But a buster is a buster for life He makes excuses why his ass ain't pay That shit's played Cash rules everything around me, kid I hit a 50'000 lick and never did no bid Cause I'm bent on a come-up and my shit stays tight How many fake gangsta rappers will I hear tonight? It don't matter cause the real don't care You know I'ma gonna get mine, so I'ma let em get theirs But I know in the heart what's true So if you listen very closely, maybe you will too My mind's blown off Armani suits Pavet medaillons, boots Cristal and steak, shrimp big as your hand I bought a silk robe and it's from Siam This jam's for the hoods and thugs Pimps and hoes, the slingers of drugs Hustlers and thieves, cons and crooks Bookers and sharks, muthafuck the marks Nigga
Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy But damn. Just a kid, moms died when I was seven Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven? It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage In the heart of a child who never knew his roots Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk Truckin diamonds and gold Rubberbands around the bankrolls Fly girls to make your head spin Seemed they partied all night long I was like, "Put me on" But they said, "Little fellow, run and go play Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day" I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat And I know I can be better than this I gotta get me a car, man I gotta get a girl I know I can do it out there, man I'm finna go for it, man I gotta get some money Word Streets of anger, trouble and crime I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime But I never let another player see me down I kept my front up, my gear clean Even when checkin minor green Brothers knew my game was true So I hooked up with the real crew That knew excactly what to do Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools Pimpin hoes on the block Checkin cash non-stop Crack spots, armor with interior bars No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars Every piece Fila made Drape my women in suede Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays It was on, crazy out of control We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years What Daff is dead? Carter got 25 years? Nah. Spike 35 to life? Nah, don't tell me B. O. 's dead, man I don't wanna hear that, man I was just with him The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun I get phone calls from condemned row Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know They tell me, "Ice you got much love in the pen You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in" They tell me, "Tell the little homies the deal Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel" I marched two million strong in D. C. Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real But health and liberty is all we need for us to build We gotta come together, unseparated Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related

Yeah This is Ice-T I'ma slow it down for a minute I wanna talk to all the ladies out there I got my man J-e-ll in the house I got a message I wanna send out to all the fly ladies, yeah Check me out It's time for me to kick game And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name Now real brothers ain't easy to understand And it's a long hard road to become a man Drama seeks and chases him through every year His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee But every man slows down You'll see this side when there's probably no one around And there's no safer place Than if you ever are some gee's homebase But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts It's gonna take time before the trust starts But girl, you must be true Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there Show him that you really care Trust me, you move with time Through the darkened halls of his mind You just might find The me inside of a gangsta Yo, Jell You know what I'm sayin? I try to represent for all the brothers out there And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man Won't you let em know how it's goin down Man, I'm lookin for a hina that's down But you don't have to be brown If you wanna hang around All you gotta do is stay in check Cause if you're rubbin me right Then you can bet you'll get respect And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show How can you hide somethin that's in your soul? Cause there's more to the l-o-c Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be I know my dogs and me can still pull straps But I rather have you rollin in my Cadillac Cause when we cruisin, thangs is all good And that goes for every vato in the hood Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide Cause East L. A. don't play And if I had my way I'd kick it with you everyday Whether black or brown, the situation's the same Different hoods, but the same game Some girls won't take their time Others will stroll through our souls and find The me inside of a gangsta

A child was born in the East one day Moved to the West coast after his parents passed away Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats In poetry he was considered elite Became a young gangster in the streets of L. A. Lost connections with his true roots far away But no matter the job or crime He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme New York's hip hop movement broke loose DJ's cut records, raps had the juice Since busting rhymes was his natural thing He was crowned the west coast MC king But after his inauguration there was a rush Of wack rappers with one intention to crush This master rapper and take his throne A simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone Assassins came in groups of one through five With raps no mortal MC could survive But he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty Battling from Friday on through to Thursday Never losin a bout, never ending in doubt Every confrontation K. O. knock out On his never ending journey to the T. O. P. The L. A. player M. C. ICE-T Magnificent rhymer, I'm the ill beat designer If they ask you if I'm def, don't front and say kinda Merciless, meticulous, so fresh it's ridiculous I'm raised in the heart of Los A-N-G-E-L-E-S King word connector, the vocal projector Your girl tried to jock me, I had to reject her Always adventurous voice some say is sensuous Now, I'm on the mic so I think I better mention this I don't like Gucci, Fila, Louie or Fendi Those are fads and I ain't trendy But whether your name's Lucy, Terry, Laura or Cindy Ice got beef and this ain't Wendy's Bust a move while I'm talkin' Sucker rappers I be stalkin' When they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin' They slow down, turn around and ask was that Ice? Then they see me cold countin' my cash Rhyme pays! Moves must be busted, girls can't be trusted I looked at your lady and I was disgusted Came into the party just to rock the place And your big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face I don't mean to diss her, but do you kiss her? Look at her lips, she got them crazy blisters Body that smells like the New York mets Arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat I hope this something that you never forget Tie that freak outside next time you come in the set Because my jams be crazy, packed with all fly ladies I'm talkin' def girlies and I don't mean maybe The way I rhyme no one will ever slay me And I ain't lyin' rhyme do pay me! Rhyme pays! I'm notorious, I'm infamous, like a snake I'm venomous For those who may diss I think you should consider this I can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle Dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle But this record is for radio S-T-E-R-E-O It not to be banned or for some underground mix show My hearts in my pen every time I begin Sometimes my lyrics go crazy and I just can't control em my friend I try to edit what I'm rappin' about But I can't write polite my anger just jumps out! Perpetrators in the business claim their hard as hell Talkin' that gangster shit, know'n they're soft as jell- Oh! I better chill out before I ill out And my negative potential just might spill out And then this record won't be gettin played I'll save that rap for another day -Rhyme pays- The front stage area goes into hysteria As I start to rhyme and unleash my criteria Of what is to come during the beat of the drum And Evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb Using his intricate moves, the record stays in the groove My boy cuts like Jason, it's easy to prove That Evil E is the great, his cuts are real not fake Not emulated effects or a play back tape So suckers witness your fate while Evil demonstrates I'm bout to get off this mic, E. , dog the break - Kick it! Like me if ya want'a, diss me if you're gonna But my jam will still be kickin' on your neighborhood corner As my bass is max'n out the V. U. S. on your box There'll be no doubt within your mind whether this MC do rock Like granite, I planned it, So you could understand it If someone's talkin' when I'm rhymin' Then just say, "Damn shut up! " While Ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin' Maybe they're just jealous of the dollars I'm makin' But you're down with me. You know god gifted me Black kids say I'm trech, white kids say I'm nifty Spell out my name ya go I-C-E T But right now it's time for Evil E to hit me! Rhyme pays, buys my food every night and day It pays my rent my bills I guess I'm doin' ok But when I say rhyme pays, I mean in different ways Cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day It makes me feel real nice when someone likes the Ice Or some young MC asks me for advice But there will always be rappers who hate Ice T Maybe I dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy Inevitable situation, sucker rapper frustration I rhyme too tough to bite, too intricate for notation Syllables jumble, competitors crumble as they witness mic attack And the microphone rumbles like hurricane I maim, sometimes I go insane Step toward my rap and I inflict the pain! No shame Ice capital T's my name! Damn there I go illin' out again! Rhyme pays
So the people can get down to the funky sound Cause my crew don't mess around So the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor Make the guys get dizzy Totally def as Evil E guts the records and the beat is kept Stupid fly, it's got to the F-U-N-K why? So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost The lyric layer rhyme sayer, born to be player If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor Rap rhythm is erratic, time is four, four I'm the microphone scholar, clockin' long dollars Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler Genius vocalist, rhyme style priceless Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my first The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco With the speed to exceed, make other MC's look slow mo Un-lease release words mean as a beast I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH D This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice T Make it funky Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt It's rough the beat is gangsterous, call it tough If you're diss'n stop frontin', come on whats up? Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face Vegas got my highs, E. V's got control my bass My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste Now's the time do body work here's the place Make it funky Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough 'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama Intense suspense my voice emcee I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense The girlies do be wild'n'as I'm profilin' Limos lined around the block for about a mile'n'a half Autographs the list goes on If you forgot it "make it funky" is the name of this song Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again 'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E Put your finger on the records Make it, Make it funky Make it funky
Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it Now you're at the jam but in for a shock Stupid big line wrapped around the block Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls Cause as you look around all you could see were girls I love ladies I think it's time that I tell the truth I been dissin' females since my early youth But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without Female companionship is my one vice I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have Not that hangs around me They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it We try to supress it until they undress it And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it No man can deny it so don't even try it! I love ladies Ladies are you with me? I Love Ladies Ladies are you with me? That sounds nice I'm junkie for females and that's a fact I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back Don't dig goin' to the movies alone Or talkin' to myself on the telephone Goin' to a disco that's packed with men That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes And man if females are one thing that you don't need You better get away from me at a high rate of speed Cause if you don't like them you must like men And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin Because to me women are God's true gift There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with I love ladies I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme She said "Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind" I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth The next thing I knew I was at her house Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded My knees started knockin', I tried to run She said "Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come" This girl meant business I had no doubt This is just about the time that the Ice passed out The next day I woke the girl was through Room still smokin', my legs black and blue My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight She was the best y'all, yes on this earth I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice I love ladies Ladies are you with me? I Love Ladies Ladies are you with me? That sounds nice No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how When I ask for a reply they always scream owww! It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill Maybe they scared if they say ho! They might lose their cool But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance They did not come with no intention to party or dance You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone We love ladies

Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow Talkin' bout the way They rocked the mic at the disco I liked how that shit was goin' down With my own sound So I tried to write rhymes Somethin' like them, my boys said, "That ain't you Ice, That shit sounds like them. " So I sat back, thought up a new track Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure Facts. Motherfuckers got scared Cause they weas unprepaired who would tell it how it relly was? Who dared? A motherfucker from the West Coast L. A. South Central fool Where the Crips and the Bloods play When I wrote about parties It didn't fit Six in the Mornin' That was the real shit O. G.

" Well, moms, good luck Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen And my lyrics break out mad I try to write about fun andthe goodtimes But the pen yanks away and explodes And destroys the rhyme Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from L. A. that was a shot gun!
Upon intial contact with Ice-T's music, I had envisioned him to be an ill- Mannered and psychologically Unstable man with an extremely Uneducated and barbaric Frame of mind, whose raps displayed Nothing but ridiculous jaargon, Shocking sexual audacity and Repulsive images of the ghetto. However, after further analysis of His music I can deduce That he is the epitome of Antidisestblishmentarianism who Embodies the entire spectrum of the Urban experience and struggle. But to make things more plain and Simple to the lymn, I find Ice-T to be The dopest, flyist, O. G. pimp hustler Gangster plyer hardcore Motherfucker living today. To be honest I'm totally and Irrevocably on his dick
Just checkin' my microphone once As I check your audio Increase the bass response Hope n the speakers blow I got no time to sit and flip And pop bullshit Turn up your stereo hops Insert the rhyme clip Roll your windows up Make sure it's air tight E. Q. the track exact So shit sounds right I rhyme of death And darkness and danger Your crib or car Becomes a torture chamber I write my rhymes with violence What you expect? Sounds of pain The snap of a broken neck All alone in darkness I sit each night Write my rhymes With blood upon a butcher knife You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am They try to ban my shit And I don't give a damn Roll up, your eye will get swoll up Suckers who flexed Yo, their deaths got tolled up Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with Boy with the big mouth Ya got time to riff? There's time to take you out Put a couple caps in your ass Cut your head off Send it to your mom with flowers Cause I'm so soft Lay on your wack crew Smoke the whole bunch Bury 'em in my bck yard And then I'll eat lunch Cause I don't give a fuck about you Or him or her Whenever I'm in the house A death just might occur Is this real or fiction You'll never know While you're locked to the Pulse of the rhyme flow! Once I lock you up, you can't get loose You put your head inside And I placed the noose The mic drips juice slow From its steel mesh My words feel like hooks Underneath your flesh Makin' you twist and turn Scorch and burn, when will you learn? The '90s are my turn To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit! Watch me dod it, as I do it And I do it right Grab the gauge Duct tape on the flashlight Doin' the black ski mask And come to your house Cut off your power And do you with the lights out! Is this real or fiction? You'll never know A pool of blood and floating body parts Would make me grin A close view of a razor When it's breaking skin If you were burnin' I'd use gasoline to put you out Cause I walk alone And choose the dark route Nightmares gotta be loved by some And I'm the one Ya wanna come, bring your shotgun You ever see your partner die? No? Well I have! You ever see your father die? No? Well I have! You ever see your mother die? No? Well I have! So shut the fuck up, punk And clear the rhyme path! What would make meel calm and nice Is a slow slice Through your jugular and windpipe Throw me in jail I won't even try to make bail Put me in the gas chamber And watch me inhale! Is this true or false? Well you'll never know Jason, Tales from the Crypt And the Dark Side Another fly murder, another suicide Did these flicks Have an influence on my brain? I really doubt that shit I think that I was born insane When I was young I had a lust for knives and guns Use a magnifying glass To fry an ant with the sun And on and on My lust for death got bigger At fifteen I was placed behind a trigger Although I'm dirty Not the one to be swept up step up, I'd love to open your chest up I've got no concept of life or death All I want is your last breath Give me a motherfuckin' break I should behave Give me a motherfuckin' shovel I'll dig graves! I break ill in extra large portions where's your parents I'll make you an orphan So when you're talkin' crazy You better think of me The I, to the C, to the E, to the fuckin' T! There'll be no tears No screams or cries, just a laser beam Between your fuckin' eyes You feel strange well now you know

Watch me flip and rip On the freedom tip Open your mind See the point of the ice pick I stand tall While my brothers Still choose to crawl Black power, it7s in effect yall But you don't understand You're still a slave to the man Prepare for revolution Some sucker say we're free I gotta disagree Half my posse's in the penitentiary So I'm a drop and kick the science With defiance Because I have no alliance With suckas who choose Not to act Black When they are Black Get out my face with that You better ease back Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones Not in a windowed room But in a barred one While his wife had tears in her eyes The man is a hero He needs a Nobel Prize But that will never happen So I'm gonna keep rappin' Freein' my brothers' minds From their entrapment To silence the Ice, they'll probably Put a bullet in me But I'm prepared to die And Mandela's free!
It's eight a. m. I roll out my silk sheets Get fly crash the limo back seats Lookin' in the faces Of some ladies that I never met On the interview tip, no sweat They ask me questions I throw the words back They say they write facts I know that's bull crap They're kickin' drama But then drama's my middle name That's the price ya pay for big fame The cellular phone rings Dot wanta pick it up But it's my J-O-B I gotta kick it up Another damn reporter On the line with a word quiz I gotta show cause I'm livin' with the show Biz. Out the llimo, to the plane In the pourin' rain I hate flyin' But there's no time for slow trains another show to do I gotta caatch my crew They left last night In the bus around two The plane's a small one No fun at all Bouncin' round the air Like a tennis ball When it touches down I wanna kiss the ground But it's time to wreck a new town Get to the arena, meet up with the crew They tell me all the speakers blew The cordless don't work Sound man's a jerk Somebody's gonna get hurt I'm crazy mad But my fans want autographs I turn my angry frowns Into fake laughs I can't be rude Cause they wouldn't understand I in't human no more, I'm a superman You can try But you'll never understand this You can try But you'll never understand this You can try But you'll never understand this The lifestyles of the rich a and infamous Four hours till show time oh well I might as well check in the hotel Get a little rest Before it's time to play Ten brothers standin' in the hallway All with demo tapes They need the hook up They heard that I was The one to look up I can't ditch 'em Cause they already saw me I'll put my head down Maybe they'll ignore me No chance "Ice what's goin' on? " I listened to twenty-five songs And after thaat The brothers still wouldn't leave They started lookin' at my T. V. I was gonna break down If they didn't jet soon Snuck across the hall And crashed in E's room But then this freak came in Thought I was E Straddled her legs across me Ripped off her blouse Pushed her breast against my face Started girating her waist. Sounds fly, Like a hype sex thriller? But see she looked like Godzilla Pushed her off me Home girl hit the floor This is what it's like on tour I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick "Could we take this picture real quick? " Jumped into a pose That I used a million times before Took pictures With the whole damn floor I couldn't say no not to my fans You see they wouldn't understand Now it's show time, time to flow time Evil lost the records But we still gotta go time The house is packed Everybody's on their feet So I say, "Throw on Rakim's beat. " E hits the fader and the crowd is lit I start bustin' off some new shit The stage is so smokey That I almost fall off, I start inhalin' it I'm tryin' not to cough I'm catchin' problems from every angle The mic cords are tangled I try to flow smooth But my words are mangled Damn near slipped and broke my ankle If that ain't enough The police are hawkin' Listenin' real close To the words I'm talkin' They wanna put a brother like me In the back seat Just because I curse the beat They wanna tap my phone Wanna keep my crib bugged Call all my homes Felonist street thugs You might say I think this lifestyle sucks? I wouldn't tade it for a million bucks Although it's all Not glamour and gleam It's still my dream
Let me tell ya a little story Bout my homeboy Ed Use to drink every day Straight 40's to the head You try to snap on him He'd ask what you said You still try to break He'd start given up lead Love to gamble On one knee he stayed Tryin' to hit seven on one knee he stayed Worked tees and weights So he always got paid Blew on the hoes Every dollar he made Crazy friends, crazy friends he had Superfly drobe, super dope pad Cars for your ass and I'm talkin' class Benz's and better With his name on the dash One night he got drunk And started drivin' real fast. Ed's dead
I'm rollin' up in a big gray bus And I'm shackled down Myself that's who I trust The minute I arrived Some sucker got hit Shanked ten times Behind some bullshit Word in the pen the fool was a snitch So without hesitatin' I made a weapon quick If found a sharp piece of metal Taped it to a stick Then a bullhorn sounds That means it's time for chow My first prison meal The whole feeling was foul It wasn't quite my style But my stomach growled So I flushed the shit down And hit the weight pile The brothers was swole The attitudes was cold Felt the tension on the yard From the young and the old But I'm a warrior I got my ground to hold So I studied the inmates To see who hd the power the Whites? The Blacks? Or just the gun tower! In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out Blacks put their backs to the wall Cause it was north and south A gun man shouts And everybody had doubt Until the bullets started fly'n Took two men out Thn they rushed everybody Back to their cells Damn the pen is different than The county jail I'm in a one man cell I know my life's on a scale I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell This is my second day I got a ten year stay I learned my first lesson In the pen you don't plaay I saw a brother kill another Cause he said he was gay But that's the way it is It been that way for years and when his body hit the ground I heard a couple of cheers It kind of hurt me inside That they were glad he died and I ask myself Just who had the power? The Whites? The Blacks? Or just the gun tower! You see the Whites got a thing The call White pride The Blacks got the muscle Mexicans got the knives You better be wise You wanna stay alive Go toe to toe with a sucka No matter wht size A fool tried to sweat me Act'n like he was hard I stuck him twice in the neck And left him dead in the yard It was smooth how I did it Cause nobody could see With my jacket on my arm And my knife on the side of me Bam bam, it was over Another one bites the dust I went crazy in the pen With nobody to trust Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat Used a tat gun, and engrved my set They call me a lifer Cause I'm good as dead I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed And I ask myself again Who has the power The Whites? The Blacks? Or just the gun tower
Off to the studio late night Time to cut another track It's gotta be hype Got my rhyme book in hand A blue loose leaf Anybody move on that They get loose teeth Evil's got the funky beat A stupid dope loop But the record's kind of old! We gotta clean it up Cause it's so dope Tried the rubbing alcohol Even the Ivory soap But no matter what we do The record keeps clickin' FUCK IT! Evil E, give me some of that Damn fried chicken!
Before I go I'd like to say a few things This album was completed on January 15th. 1991 By now the war has probably started And a whole bunch of people have probably died out there In the desert over some bullshit There's a war going on right now in my neighborhood But I can't really determine which one is worse! I think the one, that we are all fighting is fucked up And that's the war inside our brains, you know But uhh. I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters Whose getting pulled right out of their neighborhoods An all the cities, and uhh. small towns in America That go over there and fight for that BULLSHIT! That most of them don't really have anything to do with So I gotta send PEACE Out! to them Also PEACE Out! to all my homies in jail Brothers that are dead, and locked up right here on earth Talking about the brothers in Solidad, San Quentin All the way up to Pelicans Bay, Tracy, Chino And all my homeboys out there in the East Coast lockdown facilities I'm talking about Clinton, Rykers, Jolead, You know every prison in the whole fucking world, man That's like, you know, all bullshit, you know They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felony Y'all need to think about that That lets you know what the fucking constitution really is about, you know A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career And that's some bullshit So for them, from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T I'd like to send this special shout out Fuck the police, Fuck the FBI, Fuck the DEA, Fuck the CIA Fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple BITCH! This is Ice-T, I'm out of here Told you, you should have killed me last year!
You know the houe down the street Where the kids are and every day They seem to have a new scar Something strange is going on And everybody knows Doors always shut Windows always closed The little girl had a burn The boy was black and blue They said it came from play You know that shit ain't true The boy's arm's broke Girl's scared to speak Their parents drink all day Couple of dead beats Some days they go to school And other days they might It's hard to stay awake After you cry all night You see 'em every daay Tear tracks on their cheeks But they will never tell It goes on weeks and weeks (But what can they do? They're only children man! ) You ain't no fuckin' kid Act like you give a damn! Won't someone save these kids Do something, call a cop The other night I heard gun shots!
Midnight chillin' at A. M P. M. Coolin' drinkin' apple juice In Evil's BM The sound's up loud To attract attention rmoraled tires On a lowered suspension Nardi to steer with Alpine deck was glowin' Bumpinn' Big Daddy And the nigga was definitely flowin' I was ridin' shotgun Donald and Hen in back Look thru the tint recognized a jack Two brothers strolled up Talkin' bout get out Donald D blazed Shot one fool thru his fuckin' mouth Why would they step When they know we're strapped? I never cruise L. A. Without a Gat in my lap The other fool shot Caut the E in the shoulder blade I busted thru the ca door That's where the nigga laid Hen jumped out Dropped two nines in his forehead Evil was bleedin' bad The car seats were turnin' red Looked to my left There were two more carloads Niggas in hats and hoods In an attack mode And they hadn't yet begun to fight E hit the gas It was one past midnight! We boned down Vernon Right on Normandie Left on Florence Gettin' thru the E. T. G. 's Spun out on Vermont Made a left on Colden Right on Hoover E where we goin'? He didn'T even answer that Checked the reaar view They were still out back Where were these brothers from? What made these brothers come Bang! our back window Was removed by a shotgun Now Hen G was shot Don caught a ricochet These motherfuckers was ill They didn't come to play Bust a right turn, parked and then we got left Hid in the the bushes Shot the gas tank to fake death But would this really Keep them psyched? Three of us bleedin' It was ten past midnight! I really didn't like How this shit was goin' down Wrong night, wrong time Wrong fuckin' part of town Ya see we was deep In the Hoover's hood Three niggas bleedin' That shit don't look good! See over there red don't go Some places red's all they know But not our luck Tonight we was real fucked Borke down an alley And we instantly had to duck Fuckin' police on a gang sweep No time to deal with one time So we had to creep Broke thru a back yard Ran thru a vacant lot E, Hen and Don kept up To be some niggas shot Shit was gettin' craazy So I had to get busy Hen was bleedin' worse And Evil was gettin' dizzy Looked in a parking lot I needed a snatch bar Had to hot wire So I moved on an old car It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do Started it up And scooped my whole crew Two blocks later We saw fuckin' blue lights The pigs were behind us It was half past midnight! When they pulled us over Shit got worse I waited till they got out And then I hit reverse Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty yall Don't know how But somehow we got away Lost the jackers, the cops Dumped the G. T. A. Made it back to the hood Fixed the crew up And even though Evil's car blew up We made it home and then I crashed out Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout Then somethin' woke me up From my dark sleep The sound of fuckin' police When they're tryin' to creep Broke thru my door With no goddamn warning Looked at my watch It was six in the mornin'!
Once again I'm back in the place to be The I, the C, the E, the T I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E My record label's called Warner B William Morris is my agency I'll never go broke, I got property Got a dope pitbull named Felony Got four gold albums So what you tell'n me? Power was two, Iceberg was three This one here shipped five hundred G Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep Benz's, Bemers, and boomin' Jeeps I'm always strapped Cause my money I keep You move on the Ice And you're goin' to sleep But when you see me Walkin' down the street You say, "What's up Ice? " And I say, "Peace! " You give me a dap, I give you one back Cause I ain't souped So forget about that We might take pictures Sign n utograph Kick a little flavor Have some fun and laugh But step to me wrong You might get shot And wind up lookin' out a ziplock!
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long, Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone. Got my block sewn, armored dope spots, Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop. Move like a king when I roll, hops, You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops. You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out, Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out. I got nothin to lose, much to gain, In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine. I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right. my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight. So many hos on my jock, think I'm a movie star. Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car. Go to school, I ain't goin for it, Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet. Cause I don't wanna hear that crap, Why? I'd rather be a New Jack-----Hustler Hustler Hustler Hustler H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler Yo man you know what I'm sayin? You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down. You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels. Look at that ring right there, I know it's real, it's gotta be real. Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life! Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man, How can I be down? What's up? You say you wanna be down? Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down. Out my face, fool I'm the illest, Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis. Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags, So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags. All I think about is keys and Gs Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's . That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke, When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke. Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you! I'm rollin with the New Jack crew. And I'm a hustler. H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler New Jack, New Jack. Here I come, so you better break North, As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth. I care nothing bout you, and that's evident. All I love's my dope and dead presidents. Sound crazy? Well it isn't. The ends justifies the means, that's the system. I learned that in school then I dropped out, Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout. I had nothing, and I wanted it. You had everything, and you flaunted it. Turned the needy into the greedy, With cocaine, my success came speedy. Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox. Every dollar I get, another brother drops. Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand, God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand. But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned, I gotta get paid, I got money to earn. With my posse, out on the ave, Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh. Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam, Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream? So think twice if you're coming down my block, You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot. Pregnant teens, children's screams, Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam. You don't come here much, and ya better not. Wrong move , ambulance cot. I gotta get more money than you got, So what, if some muthafucka gets shot? That's how the game is played, Another brother slayed, the wound is deep BUT they're givin us a Band Aid. My education's low but I got long dough, Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro. Sleep on silk, lie like a politician, My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician. Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe, There'll be another one after me! A hustler. Hustler. H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler. New Jack, New Jack.

Brainstorm microphone napalm This is it, words from a timebomb Attack speed, fast as an F15 Raise the heat, light thhe gasoline Overload, it might cause a blackout Dead end There's no chnce to back out Hit the tripwire Duck from the gunfire Broken glass, screech'n car tires, bodies hit the deck As I commence to wreck Eject another clip and drip sweat Face of danger, increasin' nger Point blank I smoke another stranger Grip the mic tight I see the brake lights Hit the back door I lay down cross the floor E's on the wheels He makes the rubber squel Blood's on my gear From caps I've peeled About a block away I sit up Look back It wasn't nothin' but a Microphone contract! Dressed in black I stalk my prey Parabellum in a leather attache Low tones I speak, I speak to few Just give me the money and who the fuck to do Four blocks away my aim's clean Night scope on a silence carbine Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye Squeeze the trigger Watch the brains fly Violent? Yeah you could call me that Insane? You're on the right track But turn the sounds up So I can stay amped Do another crew and breaak camp The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat You think I'm crazy? You ain't see shit yet Cause I love to kill and kill for fun The microphone goes off Like a handgun It's goin' down now Grab your girl hops No excuses when the bodies begin to drop Look in my face fool It look like I'm play'n Don't become another Victim of mic slayin' What's up? You want your feet in some concrete? I got some brothers That'll do you for gold teeth But most the time I move, I move alone Take a bat Break your motherfuckin' dome Shoot you dead in the face With a sawed off One hundred ten degrees Ice don't get soft Cause I'm hard as they come I come correct You can't handle the vandal hit eject If not you better get Out my face sucka Or else you better be A good bullet ducker Cause I'm a rip shop Tell that ass drop Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop! Cause I move hard and cold With a gangster stroll Five thousand dollar suits And fly gold Rolex, you can't fit no more Diamonds on it Pinky ring, worth a house If I decide to pwn it What's up now punk? Yo start to choke up? You try to move on the Ice You'll get broke up! Midnight, time for a homicide Showtime, somebody's gonna die E hits the switch And thouands of volts connect With the weapon that's in my fist I see a sucka in the third row Try'n to riff A paragraph and a half he's stiff I start bustin' off barrages ear high Mothers grab for their children Tears fly I'm like a psycho In the mircrophone zone Speakers blown, mind gone I can't be touched Once my lyrics begin to fly Simple stage radiation Could make ya die Ya got a prob nigga you think your rep's bigger? Hold your heard right there While I squeeze the trigger Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker That's no joke My favorite smell is The aroma of gunsmoke I'm bustin' off another Lyrical nightmare Parents hate the Ice! You think that I care? Well I don't give a fuck Cause I rhyme tough Drop science, still bust the ill stuff So now it's time for crime And the rhyme is mine Track the movement Hide from the punchline I rhyme with quickness Microphone fitness The assassinator Stay off the shit list
I once knew this brother Who I thought was cool with me Chilled out together Even went to school with me Fly nigga, my ace boon coon Used to low ride together Shot dice in the bathroom Ya want trouble? Well trouble ya found Cause we diss ya, then issue The critical beat down He needed money I would always come through Needed a car? He could use mine too But bust this! Out on the street People say he was riffin' Callin' me a sucker Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin' Someone heard him Poppin' that shit last week Frontin' for some pussy From some big butt freak Sayin' I'm his worker I was on his dick! Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit and after all of that She still walked away How ya gonna diss your boy To get some play? And when I stepped to him about it He said, "Who snitched? " Yo, how did he go out? He went out like a bitch! So ladies We ain't just talkin' bout you Cause some of you niggas Is bitches too! I knew this brother named Mitch Stone player He meet a girl, in five min. he lay her Trucked crazy jewels Hands smothered in ice Been to prison not once, but twice Kept a stupid thick posse Made of thugs and Crooks and hoods and vet hustlers Who were up to no good But they all stood behind him and watched his back That's the only way To roll on the track But yo, Mitch got rushed by feds last week The snatchbared the runk Of his white Corniche Took a look inside And what did they see? Two keys, and a gallon of PCP! Oh shit! The thought crashed Mitch's subliminal Three strikes, that's called Habitual criminal So insted of goin' under He snitched on his whole posse Maxed at the crib And sipped Martini and Rossi Sold out his whole crew That rat named Mitch I knew this guy That was never that fly Couldn't act cool Even when he tried When we played rough He always cried When he told stories, he always lied A Black brother Who was missin' the cool part He had the color But was missin' the true heart When we would fight He would always go down quick So he took karate and he still got his ass kicked But now he's married And he kicks his wife's ass Says it comes from problems That he had in the past Doesn't like Blacks Claims he's upper class Joined the police, got himself a badge Now he rolls the streets and he's cut to jack Doggin' young brothers Cause they usually don't fight back Got a White partner And he asked for that and every night Another head they crack So now he's big man But he really ain't shit! Out one night with my crew and some new kid I didn'T know homeboy, but Evil E did So I thought he was cool We rode in his ride Rag top tray on Daytons Lifted side to side We hit the party deep Niggas was hawkin' me You could feel the vibe Of thick artillery Parliament was on, some O. G. shit I put my back to the wall And felt my pistol grip al of a sudden Niggas started trippin' Flippin', the record started skippin' Wildin', fools started locn up Gats cracked The room started smokin' up Me and "E" hit the floor And then the back door My boys let off an automatic encore But when we made it out to the ride It was gone, we had to shoot it out Side by side Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down, what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself. If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

" I grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac Strapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back I said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me Say you know where they are? He said, "I know where they be" Let's peel their caps back Let's peel their caps back Twelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight Twenty-five cars, under the streetlights Some people talked, while others cried Ink was a brother, who shouldn't have died Then the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be? 38 hard brothers stood and stared at me There were only two words that I had to say P-A-Y, B-A-C-K The car's loaded with a silence that could rape the dead Pistols clipped as the chamber's loaded full of lead Everyone in the crew knew what I said would mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead Let's peel their caps back The cars at the corner like a long black snake Nightprowlin for a life to take Ya see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye That's the answer to the question why In my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump Face of Death, then I cocked my pump I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull Just layin for a reason to pull on you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way But then we spot him, Evil E shot him Dead in the face, made sure that he got him Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath Automatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath Let's peel their caps back Let's peel their caps back Let's peel their caps back Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die I drink my blood as I fell like shit into the street My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins But this drama, you'll never hear a word of cause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder Gang murder
Yo! I met this girl the other night Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits Said she came out lookin' for some fun Looked me in my eyes and told me.

She sweated and she grinned with delight And then she broke out a whip, I said "Shit! " This girl had crazy plans for the night This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life Now whips ain't all that she had All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad I'm talkin' about latex suits, spike-heeled boots Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose I said, "Don't. don't. don't whip me! I'll do anything you ask! " And then homegirl stripped, 38" tits Man you shoulda seen that ass This girl tried to kill me, she didn't use a gun or a knife This girl tried to kill me, took me within a inch of my life This freak tried to kill me, she didn't use a bomb or a gun This girl tried to kill me, homeboys, watch out for this one My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest She started pourin' baby oil on her chest And then she said, "Gimme gimme gimme" Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten I knew my life would soon end Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a bomb or a gun Homeboy tried to kill me, yo. yo, nowhere to run Homeboy tried to kill me, he didn't use a gun or a knife Homeboy tried to kill me, cos he had caught me fuckin' his wife Yo.

The home invader. Yo, moms you can basically just suck my dick! This is a home invasion. Yo, pops that shit you talkin' is noise! Word! You full of shit! Check this out, moms, I said time bomb And they sit in your house and remain calm Till you feed'em lies and the flip Start talkin' crazy shit Might call you and pops a fool Tell ya that's why they hate school Been offensive and askin' questions Give your brain indigestion Why? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth Yhey're mentally intoxicated with truth So they know the noise you talk are lies Pretty damn soon they'll be by They listen to me and i give'em the real And every night caps get peeled And every night a ho gets smacked A fool gets jacked Now, whose fuckin' fault was that? The home invaders. Yo! Yo! Yo! All that shit you taught me, mom, was full of shit! Know what I'm sayin'? How the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin' life? Bitch! You dont even know who the fuck you are! You talkin' about you don't like rap, you don't like how I dress! Yo! Fuck you and pops! I'm outta here! Both of y'all can kiss my ass.

M. R. C. suck my dick, please You can kiss my ass while you're on your knees Word! You're listening to the verbal assassinator E's the crossfader, your factual updater Until your cranium grows like uranium Hard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em For teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day While I learned about death from an A. K. But they'll never quite understand Bam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman Boom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down Me and Ice Cube are in town But the fuckin' pigs cancelled the concert They're just scared of some niggers that do work What they do?

Yo, Ice, you been down with the struggle for a long time, man. Why don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who want to get involved in this war. Take notes: real gangstas wear trench coats Grey suits, black ties and they seek votes And you're not to be misled They'll kill you in your fuckin' bed They don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do But they don't look that much like me or you But if you pull up the sheets and expose them They'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom Now I've been soldier for years Representin' the tattooed tears Other brothas locked up with no choice Left in the bowels of devil with no voice My phones are tapped, my crib is bugged My car is tailed from club to club And this ain't no fuckin' joke They want to see a nigga broke You can't slip, if you slip you're out You gotta know what you're talkin' about Drop science every chance you get Hit direct and indirect, speak in code Cause you're never alone That's why I use this low tone Follow this and you might grow older This is a message to the soldiers. Now they killed King and they shot X Now they want me, you could be next All you gotta do is speak too loud All you gotta be is be too proud Cause once you let'em know Who you are and where you're at You better watch your back Cause you might think you're just dope While you're livin' in a sniper's scope I'm not tryin' to scare you But there's a danger if you get too deep Some nights I don't sleep All you wanna do is tell the truth All you wanna do is save the youth Ice Cube knows, Souljah knows, P. E. knows They throw death blows And if you got kids or a girl that's true They'll move on them too But when I'm gone I need you to carry on You gotta be strong and fight for our salvation But there will be retaliation, soldier. To think that rap could be attacked Is ignorin' the simple fact That they never ment us to speak They had planned to keep the black man weak But rap hit the streets Black rage amplified over dope beats Now they want to shut us down And they don't fuck around Check the history books, son Black leaders die young They tell us that your words are scary They're revolutionary Because we speak the truth About crime and drugs And expose the real thugs This info is not beneficial To the groups that go by three initals So they try to discredit They'll dog you with an edit Print the words the way you never said it But we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers. Word! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war. You know what I'm sayin'? a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge to drop on our people but right now they're movin' to shut down all hip-hop! The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do with black people at the time constitution was written, we were considered nothin' but property. The expectation of havin' black people speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move! But belive me all the black leaders have been silenced and most of the time it's been violent so if you choose to get in this war, realize what you're in for but we gotta move on. And we gotta stay strong. Message to the soldiers, welcome to the struggle. Message to the soldiers, be careful, soldiers.

I was born in new jersey, I said it before But I guess nobody heard me My mother died young No sistas or brothas, I was the only son When I was twelve my pops died too What a brotha was supposed to do? They sent me out West To live with my aunt I guess they though it was the best But there was no love there Growin' with no moms I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum The bedroom the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom I didn't leave home much, didn't like L. A. Didn't have no friends to trust Got busted to a school Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool But in highschool I changed Didn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game I walked to Crenshaw high, shit was fly I hooked up with new cru Some brothas that knew what the fuck to do You might call it gang but we called it a set And it was our own thang The whole school was down And one way or another everybody fucked around When the hardcore or not you wore the right color or your ass got shot That's how i'm livin'. I did three years in and made close friends Havin' no love my homies came my only I was glad: a family I never had But I grew up fast got a girl on 10th grade pregnant Needin' cash, I had to change my style Switched from bangin' to hustlin' No more goin' buckwild Had to get a cashflow But my hustle was weak, it was a no go I join the army, four years in that shit Be all fucked you can be Came back to the hood My homies had done good Had elevated their game About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame Passed for the jewels Baby sledgehammers with the tools I speak on this with a hesitation Even though it passed the statue of limitation. I checked the bank Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank But as I grew my whole crew fell thru Cops had us on the books as innerstate crooks Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine You robbed a nigga blind I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose I was intread with the pimpgame Took on the ice-name But the pimpgame moved too slow Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough In one nite late I was in a carwreck And I was lucky to escape Hospital for teen weeks, in bed almost dead And when I got well, I got gaught in a cross And got locked in a jailcell That's how I'm livin'. They cutted me loose And I had to change troops This time they didn't catch me Next time they'll strecth me Cause my time was gettin' short All my homies was in court Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old So I changed my life Putted down the gun and picked up the mic It took ten years to get from there to here But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run And they hate me more now Than they ever did before My homies came back from pen And we all worked together True friends but every once and while Some punk mistakes me as a junk And he gets in my face Wrong mothafuckin' place And I aint lyin', that's how you dyin'.

Know what, I said it Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded That they need to be beheaded Why?

Sometimes this world means everything to me The inside is lovely to these eyes I see And sometimes in my mind all I wanna do is cry Highly up-set but nothing drops from my eye Those drain out my skin cause I'm pissed from within I see a situation now and all I do is grin People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling Aging is your times cause life's unraveling While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight People need to know about this thing called life Cause if you see the light then life's alright So can you dig it? I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission Popped in my freestyle tapes, started reminiscing About my little homie, who was raised in Wyoming, wanted to be famous So he came to Californey on the microphony He was super bad and what not But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor That he modificated, rearranged his behavior He hooked up quick with the influential slang Gangsta-stroll, cornrolls; the whole shabbang Braggin' and boastin, boastin' and braggin How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin' Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon Hopin' they'd hit him in the head, but he steady saggin' Like he a hog Creepin' through the smog Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog Like most who come to this West Coast society Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace So what a relic way to end this Got rolled up when he was strolling On a Sunday at the Venice Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson The hard way I'm guessin' yessin' Deedy as I hit the Beady and make a right on Weston Pops in my head the proverbial question

Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss Always got mad when the class was dismissed But when it was in session, I always had a question I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and help me with my problem, it was never much Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug She was married to the man, he was a thug, His name was Lee, he drove a Z, he'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus First I'd write her name then carve a plus, with my name last, on the looking glass, I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass She keeps on passin me by. When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me That I should quit chasin' and look for something better But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture I'm shootin for her heart, got my finger on the trigger She could be my broad, and I could be her But, all I can do is stare. Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated not at all over-rated, I think I need a prayer to get in her boots and it looks rather dry I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye Although she's crazy steppin, I'll try to stop her stride Cause I won't have no more of this passin me by Time for me to voice my opinion of not even pretendin she didn't have me Strung like a chicken, chase my tail like a doggie She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan Dude, she looked good, down side: she had a man He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand By lettin her pass I had proved to be a better man She keeps on passin me by. Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian And now the world around me be gets movin in slow motion when-ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try? Wait, no, i did not really pursue my little princess with persistance; And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existance From a distance I desired, secretly admired her; Wired her a letter to get her, and it went: My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I symp Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp! 'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so And if I was your man then I would be true The only lying I would do is in the bed with you Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly, PS love me tender The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender Damn! She keeps on passin me by.
