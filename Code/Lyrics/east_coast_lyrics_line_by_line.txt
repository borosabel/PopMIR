mm mm yeah a butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day as i feel this reality gently fade away riding on a thought to see where it's from gliding through a memory of a time yet to come smoke paints the air swirling images through my mind like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind and i stand at the edge cautiously awaiting as time slips by carefully navigating by the stars in the sky and i sit and i think to myself and on the horizon the sun light begins to climb and it seems like it's been so long since he shined but i'm sure it was only yesterday a cold chill of fear cut through me i felt my heart contract to my mind i brought the image of light and i expanded out of it my fear was just a shadow and then a voice spoke in my head and she said dark is not the opposite of light it's the absence of light and i thought to myself she knows what she's talking about and for a moment i knew what it was all about

as i develop the awakening mind i praise the buddhas as they shine i bow before yeah as i travel my path to join yeah ranks i make my full time task for the sake of all beings i seek the enlightened mind that i know i'll reap respect to shantideva and all the others who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers i give thanks for this world as a place to learn and for this human body that i know i've earned and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings for without them there would be no place to learn what i'm seeing there's nothing here that's not been said before but i put it down now so that i'll be sure to solidify my own views and i'll be glad if it helps anyeahne else out too if others disrespect me or give me flak i'll stop and think before i react knowing that they're going through insecure stages i'll take the opportunity to exercise patience i'll see it as a chance to help the other person nip it in the bud before it can worsen a chance for me to be strong and sure as i think on the buddhas who have come before as i praise and respect the good they've done knowing love can conquer hate in every situation we need other people in order to create the circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate situations that bring up our deepest fears so we can work to release them until they're cleared therefore it only makes sense to thank our enemies despite their intent the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength a strength from within to go the length seeing others are as important as myself i strive for a happiness of mental wealth with the interconnectedness that we share as one every action that we take affects everyeahne so in deciding for what a situation calls there is a path for the good for all i try to make my every action for that highest good with the altruistic wish to achieve buddhahood so i pledge here before everyeahne who's listening to try to make my every action for the good of all beings for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyeahnd i vow to do my best to do no harm and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma and the enlightened ones who've graduated samsara
